Chapter One 

The Gothic and Its Revivals 
Yannis Kanarakis

1. Introduction: It’s … alive!!!!! 

It is very difficult to define the Gothic as a term. There have been, of course, many attempts to do so but none 
adequately embraces its full range which includes many seemingly contrasting works. The term has been 
associated with Northern European tribes, medieval ecclesiastical architecture, and figures like Dracula, 
Cthulhu and Batman; it has been linked with concepts like the sublime, the uncanny or the doppelganger; and 
it has been used to characterize novels like Wuthering Heights, The Beloved and American Psycho, music by 
artists like Marilyn Manson, Nick Cave or Siouxsie and the Banshees, movies like Psycho, the Silence of the 
Lambs and Twilight, or even contemporary series like Vampire Diaries, True Blood or American Horror 
Story, to name but a few. All these seemingly incongruent instances are indicative of a term with a long 
historical trajectory that has been constantly shifting as a response to various socio-cultural and economic 
factors. In this sense, we might argue that the Gothic defies any definitions precisely because it is itself a term 
that is vibrant and non static, a term that refuses to die out, and which, despite its long history, is still […] 
alive and kicking.

Learning Objectives: 
 

 Familiarization with the complexity of the 
term. 

 Familiarization with the literary 
conventions and thematic preoccupations 
of the genre. 

 Understanding of the relation between 
earlier phases of the genre and its 
modern variants. 

 Ability to detect and correlate the various 
cultural expressions of the Gothic.  

 
 

A closer look at the historical conditions that gave birth to the Gothic and resulted in its rise will help 
us establish some of its basic parameters which account for its adaptability, persistence and appeal as a 
cultural form throughout the ages. The Gothic, as we will see, has been constantly transgressing its limitations 
by manifesting a great degree of inclusiveness and experimentation. This is due to the fact that it has been 
deeply affected by all major literary and artistic traditions it got in touch with, incorporating and appropriating 
elements from them in an unprecedented way and transubstantiating these elements into something new. This 
is precisely why it is such a mobile concept and also a vague term that has been self reflexively utilized to 
discuss things, emotions or ideas that lie in the twilight, are not, i.e., clear or fixed but still unformed.  

This chapter will be an overview of the long historical trajectory of the Gothic, focusing 
predominantly on Gothic fiction and the major shifts that this genre has underwent, through an examination of 
landmark Gothic texts and key critical receptions of them. Moreover, by tracing the term’s long trajectory 
from the Middle Ages to today, we will be able to foreground the way certain Gothic motifs, devices and 
conventions have developed and interacted with other genres.

The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

2. Gothic Origins 

 
Image 1.2 Karl Briullov, The Sacking of Rome 455 (1836). 

 
Let us begin by considering the origin of the term. Initially, the term was not employed in its literary or 
cultural sense, but described a group of Germanic tribes, the Goths, who resided in the Northern parts of 
Europe, and destroyed the Roman Empire in 4 AD. During the Renaissance, the revived interest in classical 
culture by implication entailed that the Goths were looked down on as savage barbarian tribes that had 
defeated one of humanity’s greatest civilizations, the Roman, thus initiating the “Dark Ages.” For people in 
the Renaissance, the Goths were identified with the medieval spirit and signified a form of outdated 
monstrosity that lacked the finesse of classic Roman culture. The fact that the Goths were tribes that produced 
no written culture was considered by highbrow Renaissance literati to be indisputable evidence of Gothic 
primitiveness and inferiority. 

There was, however, a radical shift in the use of the term during the seventeenth-century Civil War in 
England. During the Glorious Revolution, William of Orange became the new protestant King of England by 
deposing James II on grounds of his absolutist Catholicism. Through the Bill of Rights, William established 
parliament as the ruling power of England in order to curtail Catholic claims to the throne. In this way, he 
initiated not only a fundamentally modern type of state, but also, by minimizing royal intervention, the rise of 
the mercantile class, which later became the basis for the middle class. The supremacy and validity of the 
parliament was based on its historical continuity which, according to many thinkers of the time, could be 
traced back to a Gothic past. In this sense, while Catholicism was implicitly associated with a form of 
despotism, fanaticism (the inquisition) and irrationalism (belief in miracles), the Gothic came to be associated 
with liberty and democracy. It was considered to be the cradle of native institutions while historians of the 
time even considered the modern British jury system to have originated in the Goths.  

This schematic overview of the term’s inception reveals some of its basic and most defining 
characteristics that will be an integral part of the term for centuries to come. Right from its outset “Gothic” 

11 
 



Yannis Kanarakis 

was a very inclusive genre and this is precisely why it was employed for a variety of purposes. It was first 
utilized to refer loosely to a collectivity of barbaric tribes of no specific historical, cultural or geographic 
origin. In other words, from its origin the term was used as a broad, vague and flexible cluster term that could 
incorporate within its bay disparate or even conflicting ideas and traits. As David Punter argues in his seminal 
study of the genre The Literature of Terror (1980), ambivalence as a form of transgression has been one of the 
most defining characteristics of the Gothic. And, it is precisely this indefinite character of the term that 
accounts for its persistence, adaptability and mysteriousness. 

Another issue that became prominent right from the start was that the term engulfed, as one of its key 
features, a relationship with the past. From the vantage point of the Renaissance, the term signaled barbaric 
medieval crudeness that had nothing to do with classical order, harmony and refinement; it represented what 
the present had to escape from in order to advance. From a different vantage point, the very same term was 
utilized to indicate braveness, nobility, democracy, rationality, order and Englishness. In this case, 
primitiveness was obviously invested with positive qualities that highlighted racial, national and Protestant 
continuity and superiority against superstitious French Catholicism. This was precisely why the British 
statesman Edmund Burke persistently associated the Gothic with chivalric ideals throughout his political 
pamphlet Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) in his effort to differentiate native Englishness from 
the French temperament which he associated with chaos and anarchy. The Gothic, in other words, involved a 
form of relation with the past employed to define the present.

The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

 
The ideological and political implications of the way the Gothic was employed to interpret the past 

can be clearly seen in the eighteenth-century reception of Middle Age architecture. Certain eighteenth-century 
thinkers, like Edmund Burke or William Stukeley, associated the ancient monuments scattered throughout 
Britain with the invasion of Britain by the Goths and, in doing, so managed to establish a connecting line from 
Stonehenge to the ruins of medieval abbeys or monasteries and contemporary cathedrals in order to highlight 
the common Gothic heritage of England and Scotland. Many writers and poets in their turn were inspired by 
these ruins and the patriotic mythology they evoked in order to describe, or even prescribe, what they 
considered to be a glorious past.  
 

3. Towards a Gothic Sensibility  

So far we have regarded “Gothic” as a historical, political, ideological and racial term. Before turning 
to the first major eighteenth-century Gothic novels, however, let us briefly consider certain factors that paved 
the way towards the formation of a Gothic sensibility and aesthetic upon which these first novels rested. 

3.1 Ballads 

Ballads were oral narrative songs that focused on tragic or dramatic events, the origin of which could be 
traced back to French Medieval songs. These popular folk-songs were not only full of supernatural 
conventions and devices such as, fairies, elves, princes, and witches, but also contained scenes of explicit 
violence. The emphasis on suffering and death that these songs foregrounded helped develop a sense of 
physicality and materiality, which was deeply amoral and subversive in its essence, and which the Gothic 
fully embraced. 

3.2 Elizabethan Drama 

Elizabethan drama decisively contributed to the formation and 
development of a Gothic aesthetic. Drawing on the tradition of 
Revenge Tragedy, many Elizabethan plays staged violent 
crimes, deviant sexualities, madness and ghostly apparitions. 
Shakespeare’s Hamlet (1600-1601) is indicative of this trend. It 
establishes, right from the first two lines, a climate of suspicion 
and suspense, where uncertainty and doubt are the existential 
equivalents of a macabre sequence of events and images that 
are associated with incest, madness, graveyards, poisonings, 
haunting ghosts, countless murders and a dejected prince 
holding a skull in his hand, set against a nation in full disorder 
and decay. From A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1594-1595), to 
King Lear (1605-1610), and from Othello to the Tempest 
(1611), Shakespeare utilized a wide array of supernatural 
conventions as stage and plot devices to seize the audience’s 
imagination. Even though Shakespeare was not alone in the 
employment of these pre-Gothic devices, he popularized them 
to a great extent, given the position that he has occupied 
throughout the centuries in the canon of English literature and 
culture.

Augustan Literature: 
 

The term alludes to eighteenth-
century English literature. It was 

called Augustan because it imitated 
the ideals of Classical Rome as they 

flourished during the reign of 
emperor Augustus through Virgil 

and Horace. Apart from 
neoclassicism, other ideals that 
were favoured were harmony, 

balance, universality and formal 
strictness. The major writers of this 
period were Alexander Pope, John 
Dryden, Jonathan Swift and Joseph 

Addison.

3.3 Graveyard Poetry 

The Gothic is also prefigured in the works of a group of eighteenth-century poets that included, among others, 
Thomas Gray, Robert Blair, Edward Young, James Hervey, Thomas Warton, William Collins, Thomas 
Parnell, who are also known as graveyard poets. This school of poetry attacked Augustan decorum, restraint 
and rationality, by employing a discourse of intense emotions in order to express anxiety about human 
limitation and the futility of life. Their memento mori stance was suggested through motifs that involved 
darkness, tombs, medieval ruins, ghosts and melancholy.  
 

 
Image 1.4 Claude Joseph Vemet, A shipwreck in Stormy Sea (1773). 

3.4 The Sublime 

Edmund Burke’s treatise on the sublime in Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime 
and the Beautiful (1757) played a very significant role in the development and spread of Romanticism but also 
of the Gothic, because it theoretically validated this emerging sensibility. Following Longinus, Burke claimed 
that, unlike the concept of the beautiful, which evokes pleasure when being contemplated, the sublime 
generates feelings of awe and terror; it involves something attractive, yet of such intensity, extent or 
magnitude that the human faculties fail to fully comprehend, and this, in its turn, generates feelings of pain. 
The overwhelming mixture of pleasure and pain that one feels while considering the imposing grandeur of 
medieval architecture, the vastness of the galaxy, the concept of God, or even the view from Mont Blanc, is 
indicative of what Burke had in mind. The sublime, thus, was the aesthetics of infinity, incomprehension and 
terror and comprised the darker other of Enlightenment reason and optimism. Burke’s discussion, 
furthermore, was one of the first attempts to find a language that would represent fear and to consider the role 
of absence, the irrational, and transience in the formation of subjectivity.  

The above elements were disparate threats that the Gothic brought together giving them new shape 
and meaning, as we shall see. As such, it could be argued that the Ballads, Elizabethan drama, Graveyard 
poetry and Burke’s theory of the Sublime carried, in embryonic form, what would later develop into a distinct, 
an easily recognizable literary tradition; they were the pre-cursors of the Gothic.

Yannis Kanarakis 

Horace Walpole, the son of the Whig Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, played a decisive role in the 
development of the Gothic as a genre. This is not only due to the fact that he published in 1764 the founding 
Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, which was a best-seller, but also because he was responsible for 
initiating the Gothic revival in architecture by redecorating and reconstructing his house in Strawberry Hill 
according to the medieval Gothic style. It is no wonder then that most genealogies of the Gothic begin with 
Horace Walpole.  

When the prince of Otranto, Manfred’s son, dies before his wedding when a gigantic helmet falls on 
his head, Manfred sends his wife to a convent and decides to marry his son’s unwilling bride, Isabella, fearing 
that he will lose the castle should he not ensure a new heir as a mysterious prophecy dictates. Isabella attempts 
to escape Manfred by entering the subterranean vaults of the castle and is helped by Theodore, who is the son 
of Friar Jerome, the count of Falconara, and who turns out to be the rightful heir of Otranto. As it appears, 
Manfred’s grandfather got possession of the castle by devious means. In the end, Manfred not only remains 
heirless, but also mistakenly murders his only daughter and all pieces of the statue of Alfonso the Great in a 
nearby church mysteriously come together to symbolically herald the restoration of rightful ownership.  

The Castle of Otranto is the first Gothic novel to have brought together disparate earlier elements and 
shaped them into an identifiable and groundbreaking form. Moreover, this is a novel in which one can easily 
detect in germinal form what will later get to be the stock devices of the genre. Thus, a closer look at the 
novel’s early Gothic machinery will help us better understand this nascent genre.  

One of these Gothic devices can de detected from the title page of the first edition of the book (image 
1.5), where it is stated that the story has been translated by William Marshal and, as the preface adds, this is a 
translation of a manuscript written in 1529 by Onuphrio Muralto, yet, set at the time of the Crusades, between 
1095 and 1243. This device of the discovered manuscript, which has ever since been imitated by many Gothic 
writers, was actually also employed by Cervantes in Don Quixote (1605), which, according to many scholars, 
comprises one of the earliest novelistic forms. It is not accidental that both one of the first novels and also one 
of the first Gothic novels rely on this narrative technique. The device of framed narratives marks a break with 
earlier artistic forms, since it foregrounds a more complex relation with the past. In the case of Cervantes, it 
seeks to transubstantiate the earlier romance into a realistic present, while in the case of Walpole, the linearity 
of history is implicitly under question through a framed narrative that brings together past and present. 
Furthermore, this device establishes a form of temporal distance that enables the readers to safely enjoy the 
narrative since it is supposed to belong to an exotic, barbaric and Catholic past that could not possibly threaten 
the reader’s advanced present. This intricate handling of the past subsequently implies a more sophisticated 
and elaborate worldview that highlights the novelty and modernity of both debut forms. This is precisely why 
Ian Watt, one of the most influential critics and historians of the novel, calls the Gothic a sort of a 
contradiction in terms since it means the “old new” (158). 

In the preface to the second edition, however, Walpole states that his book is an attempt to blend the 
traditions of romance and novel writing in order to overcome the shortcomings of both: the naïve reliance of 
romance on improbable supernaturalism, on the one hand, and the realistic rigidity and pragmatism of the 
novel, on the other. In his attempt to legitimize this mixture, Walpole alludes to Shakespeare’s work where 
imagination and reality are perfectly fused. While doing so, Walpole also changes the subtitle of his book 
from “A Story” to “A Gothic Story,” probably seizing the opportunity that the term “Gothic” allowed him to 
incorporate contradictory terms, as we have already noted. Thus, this blend of the two genres initiated a 
rational outlook on the supernatural, which is probably why most supernatural occurrences in the novel appear 
too far fetched to induce terror but are rather ludicrous: murder by a large helmet falling from the sky, a statue 
that bleeds or a painting that sighs and walks. Such truthfulness and matter-of-factness, indicated from the 
first lines of the novel, is also evident in the coherence and pace of the story from which suspense derives.  

Moreover, whereas the preface to the first edition locates the novel in the distant past by presenting it 
as a medieval romance, the preface to the second edition, arguing for a new form of writing, essentially brings 
the novel closer to the present. Walpole achieves this by emphasizing the fact that the improbable incidents of 
his novel can be read realistically as well, as covered allegories of psychological states or political situations 
that implicitly allude to the present. Many critics claim that Walpole was influenced in this shift by the literary 
trend, that was prominent at the time, of interpreting and understanding medieval romances as dealing in 
coded form with historical anxieties of the time. This twist, as such, initiates a determining characteristic of 
the genre, according to which Gothic narratives appear to be discussing serious problems in disguised form. 
Thus, despite the fact that many Gothic stories are set in an exotic faraway past and involve improbable 

16 
 



The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

characters and events, they are actually systematically engaged, in veiled form, with realist or present 
conditions and plights.  

Another characteristic Gothic device we find in Walpole’s novel involves the genre’s typology of 
stock characters. Through its protagonist, Manfred, the novel launches a type of villain, the despotic tyrant, 
who will dominate subsequent Gothic narratives. Many critics have read Manfred’s tyrannical attitude and his 
story of succession and usurpation within a political and ideological framework. A medieval castle, after all, is 
a setting with strong political connotations and symbolisms. So, the novel could be seen as a story of an 
abusive aristocrat finally being overthrown by Theodore, who does not only happen to be the rightful owner 
of the castle, but is also sketched as a modernized type of an aristocrat. As such, the story can be read as a 
critique of aristocratic abuse and excess, where the old-fashioned feudal aristocracy is presented as a remnant 
of the past that haunts and thwarts modern bourgeois aspirations. In a similar vein, as some critics claim, 
Manfred’s portrayal can be seen as implicitly alluding to James Stuart’s despotic and superstitious 
Catholicism, which was brought down by the far more liberal and Protestant William of Orange. In this light, 
the revelation that the medieval castle rightfully belongs to Theodore seems to be fully in tune with early 
eighteenth-century attempts to reclaim the Gothic past and, thus, establish a form of historical continuity that 
is meant to reinforce patriotism.  

This specific type of villain can also, quite interestingly, be found in one of the earliest novels in 
England, Samuel Richardson’s Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1740), which is a detailed account of the 
numerous attempts made by a mischievous master to seduce his young and innocent servant. Of course, Mr. B 
is not as malevolent as Manfred, since Pamela manages in the end to change him and morally educate him; yet 
it is clear that the first Gothic novel relied more or less on the same plotline that one of the first English novels 
also did, which is symptomatic of the close affiliation existing between them. Thus, having been born at more 
or less the same time as the novel, from its very beginning the Gothic became its dark other. Unlike the novel, 
however, which in its inception aggressively defined itself against older traditions, such as the epic and the 
romance, the Gothic welcomed them. Unlike the realist novel, moreover, which was preoccupied with the 
factual, the particular, the familiar, and the present, the Gothic turned its attention towards the exotic, the 
extraordinary, the unfamiliar, and the past.

Horace Walpole, from The Castle of Otranto  
 
The lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate cloisters; and it was not easy 
for one under so much anxiety to find the door that opened into the cavern. An awful silence 
reigned throughout those subterraneous regions, except now and then some blasts of wind that 
shook the doors she had passed, and which grating on the rusty hinges were re-echoed through 
that long labyrinth of darkness. Every murmur struck her with new terror;— yet more she 
dreaded to hear the wrathful voice of Manfred urging his domestics to pursue her. She trod as 
softly as impatience would give her leave,— yet frequently stopped and listened to hear if she 
was followed. In one of those moments she thought she heard a sigh. She shuddered, and 
recoiled a few paces. In a moment she thought she heard the step of some person. Her blood 
curdled; she concluded it was Manfred. Every suggestion that horror could inspire rushed into 
her mind. She condemned her rash flight, which had thus exposed her to his rage in a place 
where her cries were not likely to draw any body to her assistance—Yet the sound seemed 
not to come from behind;— if Manfred knew where she was, he must have followed her: she 
was still in one of the cloisters, and the steps she had heard were too distinct to proceed from 
the way she had come. Cheered with this reflection, and hoping to find a friend in whoever 
was not the prince; she was going to advance, when a door that stood ajar, at some distance 
to the left, was opened gently; but ere her lamp, which she held up, could discover who 
opened it, the person recreated precipitately on seeing the light. 

Isabella, whom every incident was sufficient to dismay, hesitated whether she should 
proceed. Her dread of Manfred outweighed every other terror. The very circumstance of the 
person avoiding her, gave her a sort of courage. It could only be, she thought, some 
domestic belonging to the castle. Her gentleness had never raised her an enemy, and conscious 
innocence made her hope that, unless sent by the prince’s order to seek her, his servants would 
rather assist than prevent her flight. Fortifying herself with these reflections, and believing, 
by what she could observe, that she was near the mouth of the subterraneous cavern, she 
approached the door that had been opened; but a sudden gust of wind that met her at the door 
extinguished her lamp, and left her in total darkness. 

Words cannot paint the horror of the princess’s situation. Alone in so dismal a place, her 
mind imprinted with all the terrible events of the day, hopeless of escaping, expecting every 
moment the arrival of Manfred, and far from tranquil on knowing she was within reach of 
some body, she knew not whom, who for some cause seemed concealed thereabouts, all 
these thoughts crowded on her distracted mind, and she was ready to sink under her 
apprehensions. She addressed herself to every saint in heaven, and inwardly implored their 
assistance. For a considerable time she remained in an agony of despair. At last as softly as 
was possible, she fell for the door, and, having found it, entered trembling into the vault from 
whence she had heard the sigh and steps. It gave her a kind of momentary joy to perceive an 
imperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam from the roof of the vault, which seemed to be 
fallen in, and from where hung a fragment of earth or building, she could not distinguish 
which, that appeared to have been crushed inwards. She advanced eagerly towards this chasm, 
when she discerned a human form standing close against the wall. 

She shrieked, believing it the ghost of her betrothed Conrad. The figure advancing, said in 
a submissive voice, “ Be not alarmed lady; I will not injure you.” Isabella, a little 
encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the stranger, and recollecting that this must be 
the person who had opened the door, recovered her spirits enough to reply, “Sir, whoever you 
are, take pity on a wretched princess standing on the brink of destruction: assist me to escape 
from this fatal castle, or in a few moments I may be made miserable for ever.” “Alas!” said the 
stranger, “what can I do to assist you? I will die in your defence; but I am unacquainted with the 
castle, and want”—“Oh!” said Isabella, hastily interrupting him, “help me but to find a trap-
door that must be hereabout, and it is the greatest service you can do me; for I have not a minute 

18 
 



The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

to lose.” Saying these words she felt about on the pavement, and directed the stranger to search 
likewise for a smooth piece of brass inclosed in one of the stones. “That,” said she, “ is the 
lock, which opens with a spring, of which I know the secret. If I can find that, I may escape—
if not, alas, courteous stranger, I fear I shall have involved you in my misfortunes: Manfred 
will suspect you for the accomplice of my flight, and you will fall a victim to his 
resentment.” “I value not my life, said the stranger; and it will be some comfort to lose it in 
trying to deliver you from his tyranny.” “ Generous youth,” said Isabella, “how shall I ever 
requite”—As she uttered these words, a ray of moonshine streaming through a cranny of the ruin 
above shone directly on the lock they sought—“Oh, transport!” said Isabella, “here is the trap-
door!” and taking out a key, she touched the spring, which starting aside discovered an iron ring. 
“Lift up the door,” said the princess. The stranger obeyed; and beneath appeared some stone 
steps descending into a vault totally dark. “We must go down here,” said Isabella: “ follow 
me; dark and dismal as it is, we cannot miss our way; it leads directly to the church of Saint 
Nicholas”—“But perhaps,” added the princess modestly, “ you have no reason to leave the 
castle, nor have I farther occasion for your service; in a few minutes I shall be safe from 
Manfred’s rage— only let me know to whom I am so much obliged.” “ I will never quit 
you,” said the stranger eagerly, “ till I have placed you in safety— not think me, princess, more 
generous than I am: though you are my principal care”—The stranger was interrupted by a 
sudden noise of voices that seemed approaching, and they soon distinguished these words: 
“ Talk not to me of necromancers; I tell you she must be in the castle; I will find her in spite of 
enchantment.” “Oh, heavens!” cried Isabella, “ it is the voice of Manfred! Make haste, or we 
are ruined! and shut the trap-door after you.” Saying this, she descended the steps precipitately; 
and as the stranger hastened to follow her, he let the door slip out of his hands; it fell and the 
spring closed over it.

Yannis Kanarakis 

Another influential trendsetter of the Gothic is Ann Radcliffe. 
Radcliffe born the year Walpole published The Castle of Otranto, is 
one of the most popular first generation Gothic writers. The Mysteries 
of Udolpho (1794), one of her most successful novels, moves, like 
most of her stories, along the paradigm set by Walpole: it involves a 
story of usurpation with a well hidden family secret taking place in a 
medieval Southern European setting with remote and mysterious 
castles that suggest Catholic superstition. A villainous aristocrat is 
usually after a virtuous innocent girl without success, however, because 
in the end virtue always prevails.  

Where this novel really 
stands out in terms of its 
predecessors is in the unique way 
supernatural elements are resolved 
in the narrative. The mysteries of 
Udolpho are always much simpler 
and far more innocent than what 
Emily St. Aubert, the orphaned 
heroine of the novel, initially 
takes them to be. This is why, 
from the start of the novel, 
Emily’s father warns her about the 

dangers of overindulging into exaggerating sentimentalism. Radcliffe’s 
infamous use of prolonged suspense and suggestive atmosphere draw the 
reader, along with the heroine, into imaginative speculation, which is 
eventually undermined. In an anticlimactic way, through the use of 
rationalist explanation, things are safely put back to where they initially 
were. Indicative of this pattern is the scene in which Emily, while 
burning a mysterious manuscript, reads a sentence from it that triggers 
her wildest fears. Speculating the meaning of these words and re-
interpreting certain past events, she reaches the terrifying conclusion that 
she is an illegitimate child, which, of course, as the story establishes, is 
definitely not the case. The potential threat of a dark secret about her 
lineage, thus, is turned into a means of re-establishing familial and 
domestic order.  

In doing so, Radcliffe does not only affiliate the Gothic with the 
then dominant rationalist mode, but also aligns it with the cult of 
sentimentality, which involves the portrayal of over-sentimental and 
over-emotional characters, whose excessive sensibility is a sign of 
refinement, innocence and virtue. By bringing these seemingly 
contradictory trends together, in a fashion similar to Walpole’s blend of the old and the new romance, 
Radcliffe manages to have rationalism control excessive passion as a potential disruptive force that can 
overthrow enlightened order. By restoring reason and the middle class domestic values of her heroine, 
Radcliffe assigns to the Gothic a moral content which it seems to lack. In this respect, her stories resemble 
Samuel Richardson’s moralism in Pamela (1740) or Clarissa (1748-1749), where innocent and over-
sentimental young girls are eventually rewarded for remaining virtuous. It is precisely because of this 
emphasis on chastity that Radcliffe turns the Gothic from a morally questionable into a serious genre and 
manages to evade social criticism and become a very popular and successful author. 

Unlike, however, Richardson’s heroines, Radcliffe’s are not solely confined into private spaces, but 
occupy the public sphere as well in their effort to get away from threatening suitors. Struggling to surmount 
the perils that the narrative subjects her into, Emily is exposed to a series of sublime settings that are usually 
associated with male heroes coming from the picaresque tradition, and in the end manages to surpass obstacles 
by relying on her own self. In other words, Radcliffe’s heroines both participate in the conventional domestic 
morality fit for women, and also suggest an unconventional conception of female subjectivity that is an 
indispensable part of open, communal life. In their attempt to escape the imposing castles of patriarchal 

Sensibility: 
 

The notion of sensibility was 
closely connected with 

eighteenth-century 
philosophy and literature, 
and involved the display of 

emotions and emotionality as 
an indication of social rank. 

This tradition of the excess of 
feeling was soon ridiculed 

and parodied by its 
opponents. A typical example 

of a critique urged against 
this early tradition was Jane 

Austen’s novel Sense and 
Sensibility (1811). 

Picaresque Novel: 
 

The Picaresque tradition is 
considered one of the 

earliest novelistic forms; it 
involved the adventures 
and journeys of a picaro, 

that is a low-class 
character. The fact that the 

hero was a marginal 
character, made these 
narratives maintain an 

ironic distance towards the 
frivolities and follies of the 

society of the time. This 
genre developed in 16th-

century Spain and 
Cervantes incorporated 

some of its elements in his 
masterpiece Don Quixote 

(1605, 1615). This tradition 
also influenced early 

English novelists: Daniel 
Defoe’s Moll Flanders 

(1722) and Henry Fielding’s 
Joseph Andrews (1742).

The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

tyranny, these heroines enter misty, supernatural labyrinths, overcome hardships and reemerge out in the light 
not only with a newly defined self but also with a language of their own, able to articulate female experience.  

The Gothic was, after all, one of the first genres that attracted female authors who wrote about and for 
a predominantly middle class reading public. Ellen Moers, in her seminal study Literary Women (1977), talks 
about a “female Gothic,” to refer to the tradition established by Anna Laetitia Aikin (or Mrs. Barbauld), 
Charlotte Smith, Harriet & Sophia Lee, Eliza Parsons, Maria Regina Roche, to name but a few. In the works 
of all these women writers, there is a permeating pattern of an innocent heroine, oppressed by a figure of 
patriarchal authority, who tries to reclaim her rightful private domain, a room of her own, and her right to self-
definition. Gothic conventions were utilized by these writers in order not only to denote female plight but also 
to suggest the mystery, awe and pain that this new uncharted territory of female condition generated. The 
mistiness of Gothic tropes reflects the agonies and struggles female authors had to go through, since the only 
language available at the time, the language of patriarchy, could not encapsulate the emotions and thoughts of 
women who wanted to express their dissatisfaction with it.  

It comes as no surprise then that the Gothic captured at the time the female imaginary to the extent 
that it did. Through the language of emotion and the decorum of sensibility, women of all ranks could both 
identify with these poor Gothic heroines and also be implicitly taught how to control the disruptive forces 
inherent in their feelings. This is precisely the theme of Jane Austen’s parody of the genre in Northanger 
Abbey, a novel she began writing in 1798, when the Gothic was at its heyday, but published in 1818. 
Catherine Morland’s dream of becoming like one of the popular and fashionable heroines of Gothic fiction is 
about to come true wneh she is invited to stay in a friendly estate. To the heroine’s dismay, however, 
Northanger Abbey has no hidden manuscripts or secrets to reveal and there is no mystery in its owner’s death. 
Like Don Quixote, whose perception of the world is shaped by the tradition of romance, Catherine is deeply 
influenced by the conventions of Gothic fiction, revealing the extent to which this form of literature was 
popular at the time for middle class women. Just like Radcliffe, Austen seeks to control this emotional excess 
through parody as a means of maintaining a rationalist integrity, synonymous with middle class morality. That 
is why, in her novel, excessive emotionalism is considered non-English; it is associated with foreign mentality 
and a specific historic event that was threatening for England at the time of the French Revolution.

Ann Radcliffe, The Mysteries of Udolpho  
 
Volume 2, Chapter 5 
 
In this extract we witness Emily’s reactions as evil Montoni approaches his castle.  
 
Towards the close of day, the road wound into a deep valley. Mountains, whose shaggy steeps 
appeared to be inaccessible, almost surrounded it. To the east, a vista opened, that exhibited the 
Apennines in their darkest horrors; and the long perspective of retiring summits, rising over each 
other, their ridges clothed with pines, exhibited a stronger image of grandeur, than any that Emily 
had yet seen. The sun had just sunk below the top of the mountains she was descending, whose long 
shadow stretched athwart the valley, but his sloping rays, shooting through an opening of the cliffs, 
touched with a yellow gleam the summits of the forest, that hung upon the opposite steeps, and 
streamed in full splendour upon the towers and battlements of a castle, that spread its extensive 
ramparts along the brow of a precipice above. The splendour of these illumined objects was 
heightened by the contrasted shade, which involved the valley below. 
“There,” said Montoni, speaking for the first time in several hours, “is Udolpho.” 

Emily gazed with melancholy awe upon the castle, which she understood to be Montoni’s; 
for, though it was now lighted up by the setting sun, the Gothic greatness of its features, and its 
mouldering walls of dark grey stone, rendered it a gloomy and sublime object. As she gazed, the 
light died away on its walls, leaving a melancholy purple tint, which spread deeper and deeper, as 
the thin vapour crept up the mountain, while the battlements above were still tipped with splendour. 
From those too, the rays soon faded, and the whole edifice was invested with the solemn duskiness 
of evening. Silent, lonely and sublime, it seemed to stand the sovereign of the scene, and to frown 
defiance on all who dared to invade its solitary reign. As the twilight deepened, its features became 
more awful in obscurity, and Emily continued to gaze, till its clustering towers were alone seen, 
rising over the tops of the woods, beneath whose thick shade the carriages soon after began to 
ascend. 

The extent and darkness of these tall woods awakened terrific images in her mind, and she 
almost expected to see banditti start up from under the trees. At length, the carriages emerged upon 
a heathy rock, and, soon after, reached the castle gates, where the deep tone of the portal bell, which 
was struck upon to give notice of their arrival, increased the fearful emotions that had assailed 
Emily. While they waited till the servant within should come to open the gates, she anxiously 
surveyed the edifice: but the gloom that overspread it allowed her to distinguish little more than a 
part of its outline, with the massy walls of the ramparts, and to know that it was vast, ancient and 
dreary. From the parts she saw, she judged of the heavy strength and extent of the whole. The 
gateway before her, leading into the courts, was of gigantic size, and was defended by two round 
towers, crowned by overhanging turrets, embattled, where instead of banners, now waved long 
grass and wild plants, that had taken root among the mouldering stones, and which seemed to sigh, 
as the breeze rolled past, over the desolation around them. The towers were united by a curtain, 
pierced and embattled also, below which appeared the pointed arch of an huge portcullis, 
surmounting the gates: from these, the walls of the ramparts extended to other towers, overlooking 
the precipice, whose shattered outline, appearing on a gleam that lingered in the west, told of the 
ravages of war.—Beyond these all was lost in the obscurity of evening. 

While Emily gazed with awe upon the scene, footsteps were heard within the gates, and the 
undrawing of the bolts; after which an ancient servant of the castle appeared, forcing back the huge 
folds of the portal, to admit his lord. As the carriage-wheels rolled heavily under the portcullis, 
Emily's heart sunk, and she seemed as if she was going into her prison; the gloomy court into which 
she passed served to confirm the idea, and her imagination, ever awake to circumstance, suggested 
even more terrors than her reason could justify. 

22 
 



The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

Another gate delivered them into the second court, grass-grown, and more wild than the 
first, where, as she surveyed through the twilight its desolation—its lofty walls, overtopped with 
briony, moss and nightshade, and the embattled towers that rose above,—long-suffering and murder 
came to her thoughts. One of those instantaneous and unaccountable convictions, which sometimes 
conquer even strong minds, impressed her with its horror. The sentiment was not diminished when 
she entered an extensive Gothic hall, obscured by the gloom of evening, which a light, glimmering 
at a distance through a long perspective of arches, only rendered more striking. As a servant 
brought the lamp nearer, partial gleams fell upon the pillars and the pointed arches, forming a 
strong contrast with their shadows, that stretched along the pavement and the walls. 

6. The Terrors of French Revolution 

Starting with the Marquis de Sade, there has been a critical tradition of considering the Gothic of the 1790s as 
a cultural response to the political and ideological implications of the French Revolution. As the American 
eighteenth century scholar Ronald Paulson argues, in Representations of Revolution (1983), the English 
expressed their anxieties about the French revolutionary events predominantly through the Gothic. The 
English shock about the events that followed the revolution was typically dramatized in Gothic fiction through 
the feelings of sublimity that young innocent heroines like Emily in The Mysteries of Udolpho felt, while 
witnessing the excessive violence, despotic oppression or unlawful acts of usurpation of continental villains 
like Montoni. The resolution of these tales, where domestic values were firmly reaffirmed also, became an 
implicit way of reminding readers of Protestant and patriotic values. The recurring Gothic setting of remote 
and mysterious Catholic castles, on the other hand, became a very fitting locus, which evoked not only the ills 
of the ancient aristocratic regime that actually brought about the revolution, but also suggested the violent 
deaths of French nobility that followed the outbreak of the revolution and the social upheaval and disorder that 
they triggered. The Revolution’s emblem was, after all, the Bastille, the castle-prison which was stormed in 
1789 by an angry mob, thus initiating the Revolution.  

The literary illustration of this scene is nowhere more evident than in Matthew Lewis’ The Monk, 
probably the most scandalous of all early Gothic novels, which was published in 1796, three years after 
Udolpho. The Monk has nothing to do with Radcliffe’s artful suggestiveness. Lewis’ narrative resembles the 
Gothic setting of a labyrinth, where many plotlines, characters, intertextual allusions become the background 
against which a series of illicit passions and unspeakable vices are sensationally dramatized; incest, cross-
dressing, diabolism, sacrilege, desecration, rape, mutilation, dismembering, murder, and matricide, are only 
some of the disturbances that Lewis’ book contains. When, towards the end of the novel, the atrocities taking 
place at the Priory of St. Clare are revealed, an angry group of people rushes to destroy the convent and tear 
its tyrannical abbess to pieces. Lewis’ diction in this scene, which highlights the threatening frenzy of the 
mob, seems to be accurately reflecting the terror of the storming of the Bastille, rendering this scene one of the 
most discussed parts of the book. According to the Marquis de Sade, Lewis’ fiction was “the fruit of the 
revolution of which all Europe felt the shock” (Varma 217), as he admits while discussing Radcliffe and The 
Monk.  

So, both Radcliffe and Lewis are “fruits” of the revolution in the sense that they both dramatize 
evidently, in different ways, the dangers of uncontrolled passions and emotions. By setting these emotional 
excesses in Catholic Europe, they both implicitly foreground a form of rationalism which for them comprises 
the predominant characteristic of the English constitution, and which, they seem to believe, distinguishes the 
English from the Europeans. The emphasis, however, with which they also underline the necessity to control 
passions, by implication, indicates that the eighteenth-century belief in reason is irreversibly undermined. 
Thus, in their works we can find Enlightenment reason standing side by side with its opposites, imagination, 
sympathy and individual idiosyncrasy, all ideas associated with the outbreak of the French Revolution.

Yannis Kanarakis 

Matthew Lewis, The Monk 
 
This extract from the end of the book alludes to the mob violence of the storming of Bastille. 
 

But when [St. Ursula] related the inhuman murder of Agnes, the indignation of the mob was so 
audibly testified, that it was scarcely possible to hear the conclusion. The confusion increased with 
every moment; at length a multitude of voices exclaimed, that the Prioress should be given up to their 
fury. To this Don Ramirez refused to consent positively. Even Lorenzo bade the people remember, 
that she had undergone no trial, and advised them to leave her punishment to the Inquisition. All 
representations were fruitless; the disturbance grew still more violent, and the populace more 
exasperated. In vain did Ramirez attempt to convey his prisoner out of the throng. Wherever he 
turned, a band of rioters barred his passage, and demanded her being delivered over to them more 
loudly than before. Ramirez ordered his attendants to cut their way through the multitude: oppressed 
by numbers, it was impossible for them to draw their swords. He threatened the mob with the 
vengeance of the Inquisition: But in this moment of popular phrenzy even this dreadful name had lost 
its effect […] They forced a passage through the guards who protected their destined victim, dragged 
her from her shelter, and proceeded to take upon her a most summary and cruel vengeance. Wild with 
terror, and scarcely knowing what she said, the wretched woman shrieked for a moment’s mercy: She 
protested that she was innocent of the death of Agnes, and could clear herself from the suspicion 
beyond the power of doubt. The rioters heeded nothing but the gratification of their barbarous 
vengeance. They refused to listen to her: they showed her every sort of insult, loaded her with mud 
and filth, and called her by the most opprobrious appellations. They tore her one from another, and 
each new tormentor was more savage than the former. They stifled with howls and execrations her 
shrill cries for mercy; and dragged her through the streets, spurning her, trampling her, and treating 
her with every species of cruelty which hate of vindictive fury could invent.  
 
This extract is typical of the anti-Catholicism that permeates Gothic narratives. 
 

The Nuns were employed in religious duties established in honour of St. Clare, and to 
which no prophane was ever admitted. The chapel windows were illuminated. As they stood on the 
outside, the auditors heard the full swell of the organ, accompanied by a chorus of female 
voices, rise upon the stillness of the night. This died away, and was succeeded by a single 
strain of harmony. It was the voice of her who was destined to sustain in the procession the 
characters of St. Clare. For the office the most beautiful Virgin of Madrid was always selected, 
and she upon whom the choice fell, esteemed it as the highest of honours. While listening to the 
music, whose melody distance only seemed to render sweeter, the audience was wrapped up in 
profound attention. Universal silence prevailed through the crowd, and every heart was filled 
with reverence for religion. Every heart but Lorenzo’s. Conscious that among those who 
chuanted the praises of their God so sweetly, there were some who cloaked with devotion the 
foulest sins, their hymns inspired him with detestation at their hypocrisy. He had long 
observed with disapprobation and contempt the superstition, which governed Madrid’s 
inhabitants. His good sense had pointed out to him the artifices of the monks, and the gross 
absurdity of their miracles, wonders and supposititious reliques. He blushed to see his countrymen 
the dupes of deceptions so ridiculous, and only wished for an opportunity to free them from their 
monkish fetters. That opportunity, so long desired in vain, was at length presented to him. He 
resolved not to let it slip, but to set before the people in glaring colours, how enormous were the 
abuses but too frequently practiced in monasteries, and how unjustly public esteem was bestowed 
indiscriminately upon all who wore a religious habit. He longed for the moment destined to 
unmask the hypocrites, and convince his countrymen, that a sanctified exterior does not always 
hide a virtuous heart.

The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

7. Romantic Gothic 

 
Image 1.9 John Henry Fuseli, The Nightmare (1781). 

 
By presenting emotions and passions as uncontrollable, and by surrendering to their sublime energy, The 
Monk seems to be indirectly aligning itself with the Romantic distrust of Enlightenment reason, as we have 
seen. Romanticism was, after all, an early nineteenth-century movement that also grew as a direct response to 
the French Revolution. Romantic and Gothic aesthetics, as such, overlapped to a great extent; and for some 
critics, Gothicism is considered to be an integral part of Romanticism. They both embraced the sublime, and 
foregrounded the role of imagination and emotion; they both relied on, yet decisively modified, the 
conventions of medieval romance as a means of exploring the human psyche and the irrational; they both 
promoted, either through their heroes or through their villains, individual uniqueness and rebelliousness; and, 
last but not least, they were both preoccupied with the past.  

Thus, William Blake, the unconventional early Romantic visionary poet and illustrator, incorporated 
revolutionary imagery in his work in ways affiliated with the Gothic. In his poem “The Rime of the Ancient 
Mariner” (1798), Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834), a leading figure of British Romanticism, employed a 
form of supernatural machinery that heavily drew on Gothic tradition (the sailor-zombies, the Life-in-Death 
figure, the weird shinning of the sailor’s eyes, etc). Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822), one of the most 
rebellious Romantic idealists, wrote the Gothic romances Irvyne (1808-9) and Zastrozzi (1810). Lord Byron 
(1788-1824), one of the most influential Romantic poets, alluded in his satiric poem Don Juan (1819-24) to 
the tradition established by Radcliffe and Lewis. John Keats (1795-1821), a major Romantic poet, in his poem 
“La Belle Dame sans Merci” (1820), is based on a scene from The Monk. Finally, artists like Henry Fuseli and

Caspar David Friedrich heavily drew on Gothic conventions in their work. Fuseli’s The Nightmare, as a 
matter of fact, has become emblematic of nineteenth-century Gothicism. 

It was precisely due to this affiliation with Romanticism that the Gothic underwent a major, probably 
the most significant shift in the early nineteenth century. This change basically involved the internalization of 
Gothic norms, according to which traditional Gothic devices were meant to invoke individual inner states. The 
work that paradigmatically encapsulates this change is definitely Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein which she 
wrote at the early age of 19 and which was initially published in 1818 and then extensively revised in 1831. 
Mary was, after all, in direct contact with Romantic sensibility; she was married to Percy Shelley and knew in 
person most of the major Romantics, while her parents were two of the most influential intellectuals of the 
time, William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft.  

At the heart of Shelley’s story lies the Romantic preoccupation with nature. But she adds a dark twist 
while probing this characteristically Romantic fascination. This is achieved through Frankenstein’s 
Promethean oeuvre to replace God, which of course, echoes the radical secularization of the time, as God’s 
throne was violently usurped by science. Thus, Victor is not only a modern god but also a modern demon. 
Through this figure, Shelley has created the archetype of the mad scientist that is still even nowadays 
replicated in so many Gothic narratives. By playing god, Victor Frankenstein spawned not only a monster but 
actually a new species: modern uncertainty thriving on alienation and disillusionment. Being the dark other of 
scientific and technological progress, the creature transcends and questions conventions of the “natural” in the 
sense that it is composed of living human matter, which, nevertheless, in its totality remains disturbingly 
unnatural. By consistently illustrating the monster as being more humane than the people it gets in touch with, 
Shelley manages to blur the romantic distinctions between nature and culture and eventually dramatize 
modern anxiety and fear at the dawning of a new world. If human life could be replicated and reproduced so 
easily by bringing together different limbs and parts, then humanity could not be that important and unique 
after all. Moreover, by having “created” the creature, Victor does not only usurp God’s place but also 
motherhood, blurring in this way gender distinctions and “natural” roles. 

Shelley’s story is frightening because it synthesizes, as Romantic imagination does, diverse, opposite 
elements: fact and fiction, life and death, subject and object, nature and culture, science and metaphysics or 
art, etc. In doing so, she strategically presents the familiar in an unfamiliar light, which is actually a forecast of 
Freud’s theory of the uncanny that first appeared in 1919. While studying the meaning and the etymology of 
the word “uncanny” (das Unheimliche in German, meaning the un-homely), Freud noticed that the term 
incorporated opposing meanings. According to Freud, this linguistic vagueness implicit in the term is 
indicative of the fact that the feeling of the uncanny is generated when something lies between the explicable 
and the inexplicable, between the known and the unknown. This happens when something that we are certain 
we know is actually unknown, or when we realize that something we 
believe we do not know is actually something we knew but had 
forgotten about. This sense of uncertainty that pervades our 
perception of the world makes all things questionable and terrifying. 
That is why the uncanny can be seen as a synonym of uncertainty 
and of the repressed, or of something forgotten that still haunts the 
present and threatens to disrupt it.  

According to Terry Castle, one of the most influential 
American scholars of the eighteenth-century and gender studies, the 
feeling of the uncanny originates in the eighteenth-century attempt 
to rationalize the irrational. Such attempts are evident in Radcliffe’s 
“explained supernatural” or in Shelley’s scientific account of what 
might initially appear to be supernatural. An extreme form of 
rationalism, Castle implies, might lead to the alienation of the 
faculty of imagination, which ends up being estranged from reason 
and then repressed. As imagination is an integral part of our brain 
and of the way we perceive the world, if we try to do away with it, 
this will only lead to malfunction and distortion. Moreover, when 
imagination finds an outlet, it will violently rush out and this 
violence comes in proportion to its repression. Castle’s remarks not 

Sigmund Freud (1856-1939): 
 

Freud was the father of 
psychoanalysis and a very 

influential thinker. He 
elaborated complex theories of 
the unconscious, of sexuality, 

repression and dreams. By 
emphasizing the role of the 

unconscious in human action, 
Freud actually dissolved long 
held assumptions about the 

coherence of identity and 
thought, thus deeply influencing 

modern thought and art.

in this chapter.

And on thy cheeks a fading rose   Fast withereth too.     IV. 
 
I met a lady in the meads,  

 Full beautiful—a faery’s child,  Her hair was long, her foot was light,  15 
 And her eyes were wild.     V. 
 
I made a garland for her head,  

 And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;  She look’d at me as she did love,   And made sweet moan.  20

I set her on my pacing steed,  

 And nothing else saw all day long,  For sidelong would she bend, and sing   A faery’s song.     VII. 
 
She found me roots of relish sweet,

 And honey wild, and manna dew,  And sure in language strange she said—   “I love thee true.”     VIII. 
 
She took me to her elfin grot,  

 And there she wept, and sigh’d fill sore,  30

Yannis Kanarakis 

In the second part of the nineteenth century, the Gothic experienced 
a sort of revival in the works of writers like R. L. Stevenson, Oscar 
Wilde and Bram Stoker, and was also used by many different 
authors who belonged to different literary traditions as 
predominantly a device that more systematically now signified 
psychological depth. Thus, the Gothic was diffused into 
sensationalism, social critique, and the ghost story as a means of 
addressing the domestic dramas of urbanized and industrialized 
centers. Even nineteenth-century realists incorporated Gothic 
elements into their writing, in order to dramatize the modern 
horrors that individuals experienced in industrialized cities. In its 
diffusion, expansion and contact with other genres, the Gothic 
unavoidably changed. Malevolent aristocrats were replaced by 
criminals, medieval labyrinths by dark alleys, and stories of 
usurpation by stories of corruption, poverty, and social injustice.  

This incorporation of Gothic machinery as a means of 
increasing the dramatic and psychological efficiency and impact of 
the narrative is clearly manifested in Charles Dickens, undoubtedly 
the most prominent and emblematic writer of Victorian times. 
Dickens did not only resort to Gothic conventions and motifs to sketch the ominous signs of his times and the 
ill condition of England, but, continuing Radcliffe’s tradition, attached a moral end to them by utilizing them 
as a form of social critique. Such Gothic motifs abound in his works: the urban sceneries of Bleak House 
(1853) and Hard Times (1854) are explicitly Gothicized to evoke feelings of alienation and fear; in Oliver 
Twist (1838), the distress and agony of medieval monasteries are associated with Victorian industrial reality; 
in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841) and Oliver Twist, a young 
innocent hero or heroine are being chased by dark forces; the 
opening cemetery scene of Great Expectations (1860-1861), 
explicitly draws on Gothic conventions to create an atmosphere of 
mystery that reflects the obscurity surrounding the young hero’s 
origin; the Clennam’s family house in Little Dorrit (1855) is 
presented as a medieval Gothic castle that hides a dark secret of the 
family’s past, and so on and so forth.  

Moreover, Dickens, along with other nineteenth-century 
writers, like Sheridan Le Fanu, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot, 
actively participated in the popularization of the ghost story. Apart 
from expressing anxiety about the uncanny changes that living in a 
modern industrial city entailed, this concern with the ghost also 
conveyed nostalgia for a non-secularized, non-materialist and non-
rationalized past, as A Christmas Carol (1843) very cleverly 
illustrated. The modernized Gothic setting was no longer related 
with the distant medieval past, yet it always retained its interest in 
the past, which was either mythologized or glorified, or 
domesticated as a haunting specter: a dark guilty family secret, 
usually having to do with some sort of low social origin or some 
kind of sexual secret that threatened the present. The frightening aspect of ghosts involved the fact that they 
intruded domestic privacy, which is the locus of the family and the familiar and, in doing so, they rendered 
everything unfamiliar, that is uncanny.  

In the latter half of the nineteenth century, therefore, the Gothic appeared as the ideal device for 
depicting the individual’s relation to the past and, by extension, psychological depth. Gothic machinery was, 
in other words, paradoxically utilized to represent psychological realism, due to the fact that it had been long 
associated with emotional arousal and expression. In Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights (1847), for example, 
the psychological portrait and passionate relationship of the two protagonists is predominantly illustrated 
through many allusions to Gothic conventions. Cathy’s anxiety and restlessness is dramatized through her 
presentation as a ghost, whereas Heathcliff’s alienation and estrangement is achieved through his implicit 
association with a villainous vampire figure. In Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre (1847), Bertha Mason, the 

Sensation Novels: 
 

Sensation fiction was a late 
nineteenth-century type of novel 

writing aimed at creating 
excitement and shock in the 

readers. The genre was 
popularized by Wilkie Collins’ 
publication of The Woman in 
White (1860) which created a 
mass culture craze. Apart from 

Wilkie Collins, Mary Braddon and 
Ellen Wood published sensation 

novels. 

Psychological Realism: 
 

The term psychological realism 
refers to the accurate 

representation of the thoughts 
and feelings of a character in 

literature. Its origin can be 
traced towards the end of the 

nineteenth century with the work 
of Henry James whose work 

focused on the depiction of the 
psychological state of his 

characters rather than plot. 
James’ work influenced 

Modernist art.

The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

madwoman in the attic, is Jane’s double, as she embodies not only 
Rochester’s dark past but also Jane’s fears about a possible negative 
outcome of her marriage.  

 The character of Bertha brings to the foreground the fact 
that the Gothic was also utilized in order to represent, towards the 
end of the nineteenth century, anxieties concerning the uncertainty 
of human identity. The Gothic was, in other words, not only a 
means of attributing psychological depth to the narrative, but also a 
way of addressing the horrors implicit in this dark internal realm, 
the human mind. We should not forget that the superiority of the 
human species was radically questioned by evolutionary theories 
that were prominent at the time. These theories relentlessly 
undermined theological conceptions about the origin of man, by 
highlighting a biological account of man’s descent from very low 
forms of life that firmly foregrounded the animalism of the human 
species. In this sense, the effect that Darwinian theory had on the 
Victorian imaginary was very uncanny indeed. It challenged what 
people had been taking for granted for so many years and rendered 
reality frighteningly unfamiliar. The evolutionary worldview scientifically proved, in a fashion similar to the 
Gothic, that the present could only be conceived in its relation to the past which it carried in fossilized form. A 
series of emerging and rising sciences at the time, like anthropology, criminology, psychology, etc., validated 
the nervousness that evolutionary theory had instilled about the intricate interrelations between past and 
present, culture and nature, civilization and savagery, order and chaos. The source of these tensions no longer 
occupied the public sphere but the human mind. Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and 
Mr. Hyde (1886) is engaged precisely with the idea of disruption located within the individual’s mind rather 
than without. Moving along the line paved by Mary Shelley, Stevenson’s novel expresses anxiety about the 
fragmentation caused by modern industrialization, mechanization, alienation, specialization and science.  

The uncertainty about origins, identity and the world that 
evolutionary theory brought about was reflected in fiction in 
unstable or unreliable narratorial voices or framed narratives. Mary 
Shelley’s Frankenstein, for instance, has three basic narrators: 
Captain Walton, who in his letters to his sister encloses Victor 
Frankenstein’s tale, Victor Frankenstein, who narrates the 
monster’s story to Walton, and the monster, whose diary is 
enframed in Walton’s story. Likewise, in Henry James’ novella The 
Turn of the Screw (1898), we have a plethora of perspectives and 
points of view since an anonymous narrator gave us a story that he 
heard from a friend of his, Douglas, which he read in a letter 
written to him by Douglas’ sister about a governess with whom he 
was in love. The coexistence of so many narrative frameworks and 
perspectives generates a series of conflicting interpretations on the 
plot or certain characters. In James’ novella the reader is left 
wondering about the mental state of the governess or whether she really saw the ghosts. James instills in the 
reader the horror that there is no single truth; we can only have multiple possible interpretations of reality.  

Darwin’s Theory of Evolution: 
 

Darwin’s theory of evolution by 
natural selection was formulated 

in his book On the Origin of 
Species published in 1859 and 
involved the idea that species 

change through a gradual 
process that allows them to 

adapt to the environment as a 
means of survival. Simply put, the 
organisms that can adapt better 
have more chances of survival. 

The New Woman: 
 

The term “New Woman” was 
used towards the end of the 

nineteenth century to refer to 
emancipated women who were 
against the restrictions imposed 
on them by society. These women 

were largely influenced by the 
suffragette movement. 

31 
 



Yannis Kanarakis 

The anxiety about the instability of identity also became 
prominent through the preoccupation with the notions of 
changeability and transformation that we witness towards the end of 
the nineteenth century. Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897) foregrounds 
modern fragmentation by incorporating a variety of different genres 
and perspectives. The 
emphasis on 
transgression is best 
illustrated in the novel 
through the protagonist. 
Dracula defies definition 
by resisting stable subject 
positions or forms: he 
brings together past and 
present, life and death, 
presence and absence, 
humanity and animalism, 
horror and tenderness, 
fact and fiction, 

mythology and science. His subversive power becomes obvious 
through the fact that all characters he comes in contact with end up 
having deviant gender positions. Women become sexually 
insatiable and independent, while men become effeminately 
passive. In this, the Gothic documents fin de siécle anxieties about 

emancipated women and 
the degeneration of 
Victorian morals and norms that deviant sexual positions 
supposedly brought about. These Victorian anxieties involved 
theories of degeneration that were very much in the air at the time. 
As Dracula stands for these repressed sexual energies that allegedly 
threaten modern progress, he is destroyed in the end and order is 
restored.  

On the other hand, the supposed collapse of male 
stereotypes that the book dramatizes can be seen as an expression of 
the anxiety concerning the imperial decline of Britain that took 
place towards the end of the nineteenth century. In this sense, 
Dracula implicitly staged the insecurity generated by nationalist 
instabilities, and fears of foreign invasion. Reversely, it could also 
be seen as symptomatic of native guilt about the atrocities of the 
British Empire which, by the end of the nineteenth century, was 
considered by many Britons as nothing else but a vampire that had 
been sucking the blood of indigenous people.  
 

Fin de Siècle: 
 

This French phrase means “the 
end of a century” and can also be 

used to allude to the end of an 
era. It is traditionally employed 

to refer to the last two decades of 
the Victorian era which are also 
the threshold to Modernism. This 

was a period marked by a 
growing sense of pessimism, 

decay and decline due to the fact 
that society was considered to be 

in crisis.  

Degeneration Theory: 
 

This was a theory expressed by 
Max Nordau in his very 

influential book Degeneration 
(1892). Nordau held that 
modernity was a sort of 

pathological disease marked by 
regression rather than progress. 
Its symptoms, he argued, were 
excessive description of details 

and symbolism, i.e., the inability 
to express oneself clearly. 

Aestheticism: 
 

Aestheticism or the art for art’s 
sake movement was a late 

nineteenth century artistic trend 
which held that art should be 

autonomous and not evaluated 
in moral but only in aesthetic 

terms. The trend has its origins in 
German Idealism and in French 

literature. In England, it was 
popularized by Algernon 

Swinburne, Walter Pater and 
later by Oscar Wilde. This 
movement influenced the 

Modernists to a large extent.

Emily Brontë, Wuthering Heights  
 
In this extract, Lockwood is left alone in Heathcliff’s house which has a very Gothic atmosphere.  
 
This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard distinctly the gusty wind, and 
the driving of the snow; I heard, also, the fir-bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the 
right cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if possible; and, I thought, I 
rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple: a 
circumstance observed by me when awake, but forgotten. “ I must stop it, nevertheless!” I 
muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching an arm out to seize the 
importunate branch; instead of which, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand! 
The intense horror of nightmare came over me: I tried to draw back my arm, but the hand clung 
to it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed, “Let me in—let me in!” “Who are you?” I asked, 
struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself. “Catherine Linton,” it replied, shiveringly (why did I 
think of Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton); “I’m come home: I’d lost my 
way on the moor!” As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child’s face looking through the

window. Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off, I 
pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked 
the bedclothes: still it wailed, “Let me in!” and maintained its tenacious gripe, almost maddening 
me with fear. “How can I,” I said at length. “Let me go, if you want me to let you in,” the 
fingers relaxed. I snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid 
against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I seemed to keep them closed 
above a quarter of an hour; yet, the instant I listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on! 
“Begone!” I shouted. “I’ll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years.” It is twenty years,” 
mourned the voice: “twenty years. I’ve been aw ay  for twenty years!” Thereat began a feeble 
scratching outside, and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up, but could 
not stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in a frenzy of fright. To my confusion, I discovered the yell 
was not ideal: hasty footsteps approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a 
vigorous hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat shuddering 
yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead: the intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered 
to himself. “At last,” he said in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer “ Is anyone here?” I 
considered it best to confess my presence, for I knew Heathcliff’s accents, and feared he might 
search further if I kept quiet. With this intention, I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon 
forget the effect my action produced. 

Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers: with a candle dripping over his 
fingers, and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an 
electric shock! The light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and his agitation was so 
extreme that he could hardly pick it up. 

“It is only your guest, sir,” I called out, desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his 
cowardice further. I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare. 
“ I’m sorry I disturbed you.” 

“Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were at the commenced my host, 
setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible to hold it steady.” “And who showed 
you up to this room?” he continued, crushing his nails into the palms, and grinding his teeth to 
subdue the maxillary convulsions. “Who was it? I’ve a good mind to turn them out of the house 
this moment!” 

“It was your servant, Zillah,” I replied, flinging myself on to the floor, and rapidly 
resuming my garments. I should not care if you did, Mr. Heathcliff; she richly deserves it. I 
suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense. Well, it 
is—swarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up, I assure you. No one 
will thank you for a doze in such a den!” 

“What do you mean?” asked Heathcliff, “and what are you doing? Lie down and finish out 
the night, since you are here; but, for Heaven’s sake! don’t repeat that horrid noise; nothing 
could excuse it, unless you were having your throat cut!”

exhibition, utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to change. But the 
temptation of a discovery so singular and profound, at last overcame the suggestions of alarm. I

The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

had long since prepared my tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a 
large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments, to be the last ingredient 
required; and late one accursed night, I compounded the elements, watched them boil and 
smoke together in the glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of 
courage, drank off the potion. 

The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a 
horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death. Then these 
agonies began swiftly to subside, and I came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was 
something strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its very novelty, 
incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in body; within I was conscious of a heady 
recklessness, a current of disordered sensual images running like a mill race in my fancy, a 
solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul. I knew 
myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a 
slave to my original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me like 
wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations; and in the act, I was 
suddenly aware that I had lost in stature. 

There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside me as I write, was 
brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations. The night, however, 
was far gone into the morning—the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the conception 
of the day-the inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber; and I 
determined, flushed as I was with hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to 
my bedroom. I crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, i could 
have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet 
disclosed to them; I stole through the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my 
room, I saw for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde. 

I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but that which I 
suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature, to which I had now transferred the 
stamping efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. 
Again, in the course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue 
and control, it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted. And hence, as I think, 
it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry 
Jekyll. Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and 
plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of 
man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that 
ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome. This, too, 
was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it 
seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance, I had been 
hitherto accustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have observed that 
when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come near to me at first without a 
visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are 
commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind was pure evil.  

I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be 
attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee 
before daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once 
more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to 
myself once more with the character, the stature and the face of Henry Jekyll. 

That night I had come to the fatal cross roads. Had I approached my discovery in a 
more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious 
aspirations, all must have been otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come 
forth an angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it was neither diabolical 
nor divine; it but shook the doors of the prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives 
of Philippi, that which stood within ran forth. At that lime my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept

awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected 
was Edward Hyde. Hence, although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one 
was wholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that incongruous compound of 
whose reformation and improvement I had already learned to despair. The movement was thus 
wholly toward the worse.

In this scene in Castle Dracula, Jonathan Harker encounters the seductive women that reside there 
and then the Count himself.  
 
I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly 
real— so real that now, sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least 
believe that it was all sleep. 

I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I came into it; I 
could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had 
disturbed the long accumulation of dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young 
women, ladies by their dress and manner. I thought at the time that i must be dreaming when I 
saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor. They 
came close to me and looked at me for some time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, 
and had high aquiline noses like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes, that seemed to be 
almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was fair, as fair as can be, 
with great, wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know 
her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the 
moment how or where. All three had brilliant while teeth, that shone like pearls against the ruby 
of their voluptuous lips. There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing 
and at the same time some deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they 
would kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should 
meet Mina’s eyes and cause her pain, but it is the truth. They whispered together, and then 
they all three laughed—such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound could 
never have come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable, tingling 
sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand. The fair girl shook her head 
coquettishly, and the other two urged her on. One said: 

“Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to begin.” The other added. “He 
is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.” I lay quiet, looking out under my eyelashes in an 
agony of delightful anticipation. 

The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath 
upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling through the 
nerves as her voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one 
smells in blood. 

I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes. The 
fair girl went on her knees, and bent over me, fairly gloating. There was a deliberate 
voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she 
actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on 
the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white, sharp teeth. Lower and lower 
went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to 
fasten on my throat. Then she paused and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it 
licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the skin of my throat 
began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer—
nearer. I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the supersensitive skin of my throat, 

36 
 



The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there. I closed my eyes in a 
languorous ecstasy and waited— waited with beating heart. 

But at that instant another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning. I was 
conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my 
eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman 
and with giant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the while teeth 
champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion. But the Count! Never did 
I imagine such wrath and fury even in the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively 
blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His face 
was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met 
over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his 
arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were 
beating them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves. In a 
voice which, though low and almost a whisper, seemed to cut through the air and then ring round 
the room, he exclaimed: 

“How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when I had 
forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware how you meddle with him, 
or you’ll have to deal with me.” The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer 
him: 

“You yourself never loved; you never love!” On this the other women joined, and such a 
mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear; 
it seemed like the pleasure of fiends. The Count turned, after looking at my face attentively, 
and said in a soft whisper: 

“Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it not so? Well, now I 
promise you that when I am done with him, you shall kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I 
must awaken him, for there is work to be done.” 

“Are we to have nothing tonight?” said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to 
the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some 
living thing within it. For answer he nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and 
opened it. If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half-
smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with horror but as I looked 
they disappeared, and with them the dreadful bag. There was no door near them, and they 
could not have passed me without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of 
the moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms 
for a moment before they entirely faded away. 

Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.

9. Modernist Gothic 

 
Image 1.13 The cover from the 1916 German edition of Kafka’s The Metamorphosis. 

 
The diffusion of the Gothic into other genres and cultural modes was carried on in the twentieth 

century. Gothic elements can be traced both in modernist fiction and other popular cultural forms, like cinema 
and television, and from mid-twentieth century on, the Gothic basically continued to flourish in the domain of 
popular culture, as we shall see.  
 When it comes to twentieth century fiction, traces of the Gothic can be detected in nearly all major 
modernist texts. Modernism marked a new register of the Gothic which was now utilized as one literary 
convention among others in the service of the modernist agenda. It can be argued that during Modernism the 
Gothic in essence turned from a genre into a literary effect which, nevertheless, maintained a strong presence 
throughout the literary masterpieces of Modernist tradition. Quite indicatively, the opening poem that W. B. 
Yeats selected in order to celebrate and illustrate the new Modernist spirit in The Oxford Book of Modern 
Verse 1892-1935 (1936) was actually a celebrated extract from Walter Pater’s The Renaissance (1873). Here, 
Mona Lisa is presented by Pater as an undead vampire, a Gothic primordial femme fatale. In Heart of 
Darkness (1899), Joseph Conrad illustrates the horrors not only of the western imperialist expedition in the 
area of Congo, but also the grotesque darkness of a repressed primeval past that threatens to overthrow 
civilization. In The Dubliners (1914) and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916), James Joyce, the 
priest of high modernism, presents the catholic clergy in a light that seems to be sarcastically drawing on the 
Gothic formula of the corrupt monk who is after the innocent youth. T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land (1922) 
incorporated an army of Gothic conventions into its highly fragmentary form in order to portray modern 
alienation, impoverishment and sterility. This existentialist anxiety was further on elaborated through an 
explicit Gothic idiom in Franz Kafka’s work. His Metamorphosis (1916) involved the story of a man who

turned into an insect in order to address the issue of self-loathing implicit in modern alienation, whereas The 
Trial (1925) and The Castle (1926) invoked the suffocation that contemporary individuals feel when having to 
faced with the labyrinth of modern bureaucracy or the impenetrable castle of law. In America, the novelist 
William Faulkner employs a series of Gothic devices in order to portray the uncanny feeling that 
contemporary lifestyle generates, while Eudora Welty and Flannery O’ Connor, in their turn, present the 
problematics of female identity and sexuality set against a Southern American patriarchal rule through Gothic 
diction and imagery.

However, there were also writers who were more systematically occupied with the Gothic in the 

beginning of the twentieth century. The masterful ghost stories of the medievalist scholar M. R. James, which 
are considered as probably the most influential in the genre, exploited nearly all Gothic conventions, from 
haunted houses and castles, to lost manuscripts, apparitions from the past, and the occult. Yet, unlike Dickens’ 
ghosts, James’ ghosts are always malignant. Stories like “Canon Alberic’s Scrap-Book” (1895), “The Ash-
Tree” (1904), “The Tractate Middoth” (1911) contain sharply shocking scenes and narratives that, unlike 
Radcliffe’s, leave things unexplained and do not seek to contain the supernatural within a moral end. On the

other hand, the American author H. P. Lovecraft coined a whole new supernatural mythology, the Cthulhu 
Mythos, about a world existing in a parallel universe which constantly disrupts conventional reality. In the 
middle of the twentieth century, however, the Gothic fell into critical disfavor. Two of the most important 
critics of the time, Q. D. Leavis in Fiction and the Reading Public (1932) and, later on, her husband F. R. 
Leavis, in Revaluation (1956), attacked and condemned the Gothic. They considered it a genre unworthy of 
any serious consideration due to the fact that it resorts to unoriginal clichés and conventions.  

The Leavises harshly criticized the Gothic due to its affiliation with mainstream and popular cultural 
forms. The association established between the Gothic and pop culture became even stronger at the time of 
their critique. After having accommodated nearly all narrative forms, the Gothic appropriated the new 
mediums that emerged in the twentieth century, namely, the radio, cinema and television, as they afforded so 
many new sensationalist possibilities to be explored. During the golden age of the radio, for example, there 
were many horror radio series in the States, such as The Witch’s Tale (1931-1938), Lights Out (1934-1947) 
and Stay Tuned for Terror (1944-1945). It was actually the advent of television that curtailed the popularity of 
these shows. TV series like Tales of Tomorrow (1951-1953), Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955-1965), The Veil 
(1958), The Twilight Zone (1959-1964), One Step Beyond (1959-1961), Way Out (1961), The Outer Limits 
(1963-1965), Dark Shadows (1966-1971), Night Gallery (1969-1973), fascinated the audience with their 
captivating images and filming techniques and they are still watched by many even today.  

 
 
 

Apart from the radio and television, the Gothic was accommodated by the rising industry of the 
cinema as well, which, from its inception, drew on Gothic narratives in order to attract and thrill viewers. 
Since then, the Gothic, through the genres of thrillers, horror and fantasy movies remains one of the most 
lucrative and successful parts of the industry. All classic Gothic texts, like Dracula, Frankenstein and Dr. 
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, which holds the record of the most frequently filmed classic Gothic text, have been re-
interpreted, re-filmed and re-directed countless times. In a similar fashion to their literary corollaries, 
cinematic Gothic addressed the anxieties of the time. Thus, in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), the 
extremities of the Great War of 1914-18 are dramatized through the story of a somnambulist created by a mad 
scientist to murder innocent women. In Fritz Lang’s iconic Metropolis (1926), the parvenu class generated by 
the accelerated capitalization of the time is criticized through the film’s class of underground mechanic 
laborers who are ruthlessly exploited by a futuristic decadent oligarchy. In the 1930s version of Frankenstein, 
the creature, played by Boris Karloff, is dressed in a workman’s clothes explicitly alluding to the unemployed 
that industrialism had generated and abandoned during the Great Depression. Likewise, the Hammer studios 
produced in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s a series of movies characterized by sensuality and violence that 
expressed anxieties concerning sexual libertinism and deviations from the gender norms of the time. 
Meanwhile, directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski and Michael Powell, through their work, 
addressed the horror implicit in everyday life not as a device for cheap sensation, but rather as a subtle means 
for psychological exploration. This was also the time when the genre started attracting the attention of 
“serious” writers again.

The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

10. Postmodern Gothic 

 
Image 1.15 The cover of Ellis’ first edition of American Psycho. 

 
As we have already seen, the Gothic, since its inception, has been a hybrid form that brings together 
conflicting or opposite cultural forms in order to challenge and undermine assumptions concerning social 
norms, identity, sexuality or representation. By constantly realigning its devices and by pushing representation 
to its limits, a complex set of self-reflexive meta-narratives has developed within the Gothic tradition, which 
draw the reader’s attention on how meaning is constructed within the narrative and thus maintain an ironic 
distance and relation to the text itself. It is no wonder, then, that the Gothic, as many critics have noted, is in 
full accord with postmodernist art and culture. As a matter of fact, postmodernism, as the French post-
structuralist philosopher Jean Francois Lyotard, has argued, marks a revived interest in the sublime as a 
contemporary reminder of the limitations of reason. In light of this peculiar kinship, the dissemination of the 
Gothic has been accelerated during postmodernism into an even wider array of narratives and cultural forms 
than it did in the twentieth century, becoming, thus, an integral part of the music industry, fashion, comics, 
graphic novels, or video games. Maybe this is the reason why, since the 1970s, the Gothic has attracted so 
much critical attention and reconsideration. Some such seminal studies on the Gothic are: The Fantastic 
(1978) by the French-Bulgarian critic Tzvetan Todorov which provides an intriguing definition of the 
“fantastic” as distinct from “fantasy”; David Punter’s The Literature of Terror (1983) which broadens the 
term of Gothic as a preoccupation with fear in order to include more works in it; Rosemary Jackson’s 
Fantasy: The Literature of Subversion (1983) which enriches Todorov’s study with psychological insight; 
Chris Baldick’s In Frankenstein’s Shadow (1991) which traces the origin of Shelley’s myth; and Fred 
Botting’s Gothic (1996) which provides a very comprehensive approach to the genre.

As far as fiction is concerned, the affiliation established between postmodernism and the Gothic is not 
only manifested in writers like Stephen King, James Herbert, John Saul, Dean Koontz, Shaun Hutson and 
Clive Barker, who have basically been occupied with Gothic, horror and terror stories, but can be detected in 
nearly all genres and modes of writing from magical realism to poetry and from Afro-American fiction to 
social satire and critique, as we shall see.  

In her collection of short stories The Bloody Chamber (1979), Angela Carter, a feminist novelist and 
critic, revisited Charles Perrault’s seventeenth-century rewriting of a series of oral medieval tales. Through a 
complex set of narrative frames, which were formally in full compliance with both Gothic and postmodern 
traditions, Carter reviewed these well known tales, by fusing magic realism and the Gothic, in order to 
foreground gender, sexuality and identity issues in a manner that transcended polar distinctions and cultural or 
theoretical conventions. So, in “The Company of Wolves,” which was a rewriting of “Little Red Riding 
Hood,” the heroine does not feel threatened by the wolf but rather willingly sleeps with him. Carter here tells 
us the story of a typical innocent Gothic heroine who is ultimately saved from her malevolent husband not by 
a knight but rather by her mother, in order to discuss female sexuality and identity through a feminist 
perspective.  
 In a similar fashion, Anne Sexton, the American poet and feminist, in her poetic collection called 
Transformations (1971), revisits the fairy tales of the Grimm brothers. She initially intended the poems of the 
collection to be part of an opera for children, yet Sexton foregrounded in such a detailed manner all the 
implicit violence that lurks under the narrative of the fairy tales (incest, murder, haunting, cannibalism, rape, 
madness) that she eventually had to withdraw them. This violence is presented in an explicit Gothic idiom 
because Sexton wants to highlight the fact that these narratives, which typically address children, are full of 
stereotypes and scenes that are not as innocent as we take them to be. She manages to establish this ironic 
commentary on such traditional forms through the medium of the Gothic. As a form characterized by 
hybridity, the Gothic enables Sexton to bring together the past and the present, innocence and darkness, irony 
and horror and thus come up with a complex, postmodern narrative.  
  In Beloved (1987) Toni Morrison, a most influential Afro-American novelist, employed the device of 
the ghost with a postmodern twist. Sethe’s house is haunted by the ghost of “Beloved,” her daughter, whom 
she murdered because she wanted to spare her the life of a slave. When Sethe’s lover, Paul D, moves into her 
house the ghost disappeares and at approximately the same time a girl appears in the neighborhood. As the 
girl, Sethe’s other daughter and Sethe herself become friends, we are led to believe she is “Beloved.” The girl 
soon moves into Sethe’s house forcing her lover to leave, thus mother and daughter are eventually reunited. 
What is interesting is that through the trope of the ghost and the doublings that it generates in the narrative, 
Morrison manages to bring together the private narrative of Sethe, and the history of slavery and female 
suppression. Personal or collective history is represented here as a haunting ghost that is everywhere and

nowhere, that is both intangible and palpable, the uncanny incarnate as the return of the repressed. In this 
sense, Carter, Sexton and Morrison all participate in the rewriting of history, each drawing from the Gothic in 
her own unique way.  
 Modern Gothic, however, is not only engaged with issues of historical representation; it also 
challenges social conventions and our conception of reality. This trend is evident in The Collector (1963), a 
novel by the influential British novelist John Fowles. Fowles’ novel is based on James’ The Turn of the Screw, 
but also draws explicitly from Shakespeare’s The Tempest. After winning the football lottery, Frederic Clegg 
kidnaps Miranda and keeps her in the basement of his newly acquired house hoping that she will eventually 
fall in love with him. Miranda fails to escape, falls ill and dies and Clegg decides to kidnap another girl. 
Fowles is based on the Gothic conventions of secluded houses, abducted young girls, framed narratives 
(Miranda’s journal in the middle of the book is framed by Fred’s first person narration), lost and found 
manuscripts, and employs a very dense intertextual web in order to question good and evil, or reality and 
fiction. The reader soon realizes that Clegg’s freakishness lies in his conventionality, in the fact that he is the 
epitome of middle class propriety, whereas Miranda’s highbrow, arrogant and ultimately failed attempt to 
educate Clegg raises serious doubts about the role of high culture in the reformation of the philistines. 
Although Fowles utilizes here an army of traditional Gothic devices, he minimizes their supernatural qualities. 
The frightening, as a result, does not reside in a distant castle, but is part of our everyday world and ourselves.  

In American Psycho (1991), a very controversial work, Bret Easton Ellis, a postmodernist American 
novelist, presents his critique of capitalist culture in an explicitly Gothic idiom. Ellis’ novel is set in the 
acquisitive world of Wall Street. The horror implicit in corporate materialism and the way the modern banking 
system exploits people are addressed through the figure of the protagonist, Patrick Bateman, who is a very 
successful and fashionable banker, yet, a ruthless serial killer and rapist at the same time. Patrick is unable to 
feel any kind of remorse or shame for the pain that he inflicts on his victims, reflecting in his attitude the 
coldness, impersonality and indifference of corporate banking. As a matter of fact, Ellis’ narrative refrains 
from any psychological accounts or justifications of the hero’s behavior presenting us with a cold depthless 
surface where everything is meaningless. Patrick is a psycho not so much because of his murderous deeds but 
rather because of his detachment, impassiveness, distraction, and inability to focus and by extension feel. He 
is a fragmented and neurotic personality loosely kept together only through the social status that his position 
holds.  
 And this is precisely where the horror lies in Ellis’ novel. The book modernizes, or we might even say 
post-modernizes, the Gothic by turning the stock character of the merciless powerful aristocratic into a 90s 
“golden boy” who belongs to the modern elite caste of Wall Street bankers and is arrogantly above the law 
despite the fact that he is accountable for many crimes. The device of the Gothic castle is, in its turn, 
transmuted into the labyrinth of corporate capitalism, while the cultural corollaries, hollowness, 
commercialization, emotional and moral vacancy, are imprinted on a post-modern claustrophobic waste land. 
Ellis’ story is, in order words, a modern version of the narrative of Frankenstein; only now, the mad scientist 
is late capitalism, an economic and political system that has grown out of proportion and replaced nearly all 
existing value systems, and the creature is no longer made of disparate body parts, but rather of dissimilar 
identity pieces that loosely form a psychotic (w)hole.

am not there. It is hard for me to make sense on any given level. Myself is fabricated, an aberration. I 
am a noncontingent human being. My personality is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes 
deep and is persistent. My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago (probably at 
Harvard) if they ever did exist. There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the

uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter 
indifference toward it, I have now surpassed. I still, though, hold on to one single bleak truth: no one 
is safe, nothing is redeemed. Yet I am blameless. Each model of human behavior must be assumed to 
have some validity. Is evil something you are? Or is it something you do? My pain is constant and 
sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on 
others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this—and I have countless times, in just 
about every act I’ve committed—and coming face-to-face with these truths, there is no catharsis. I 
gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding can be extracted from my telling. 
There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confession has meant nothing.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

11. Conclusion: The End (?) 

It is has become clear through this overview why the Gothic as a genre has both persisted for such a long 
period of time and vigorously fascinated people despite its countless mutations. Formally and technically, the 
Gothic involves artistic devices and mechanisms that directly appeal to the senses creating suspense, horror, 
laughter, sympathy, fright, angst, etc., and keeping the reader, viewer, spectator or listener excited and 
attentive. Furthermore, the Gothic also provides a sort of emotional depth that everyday humdrum life most 
usually lacks. How do Gothic narratives still manage to fascinate, however, since these devices are usually 
clichéd and easily recognizable, and Gothic plotlines are conventional and predictable? It seems that they 
function very much like dreams do. According to Freud, repressed wishes and desires achieve in dreams a sort 
of fantasized fulfillment by being distorted so that they will not disturb and wake us; they acquire, in other 
words, a manifest dream form that disguises their latent nightmarish content. Likewise, the Gothic is 
implicitly addressing, through its fictions, anxieties that are too extreme to be consciously considered or 
confronted. It employs a familiar, worn-out and distinguishable form of nightmare in an attempt to give outlet 
to, parody, sublimate, or impose order upon a nightmarish disorder that resides in the realm of the 
inexpressible. As such, the Gothic can also be seen as a mechanism of organizing the constantly shifting

The Gothic and Its Revivals 
 

Re-Cap: 
 

 The Gothic emerged in the eighteenth 
century as part of Romanticism and was 
a reaction against the Enlightenment. 
 

 Since then, the Gothic has retained its 
popularity due to the fact that it is not 
only highly amusing but also a medium 
through which anxieties and fears are 
imaginatively addressed or resolved.  
 

 Its most defining characteristic is its 
adaptability, mutability and 
inclusiveness.  

 

material of life. And, since it still retains its eighteenth-century double aim to instruct and entertain, it is still 
persistently popular. Therefore, in all likelihood, the Gothic will continue to excite and thrive not only due to 
its dual character and psychological utility but also due to the fact that it is a constantly shifting and adaptable 
cultural form, and, as such, can appropriate in a very uncanny way the vital force of life itself.

Chapter Two 

Victorian and Anti-Victorian Voices 
Yannis Kanarakis 

1. Introduction 

In this chapter we will explore the radical changes that took place during Queen Victoria’s reign by focusing 
on certain key ideas or larger clusters of thoughts and the reactions that they generated. As we shall see, the 
Victorian era was a period marked by unprecedented changes, and Victorian thinkers and writers had a mixed 
reaction towards these shifts. Some of them welcomed change as a sign of progress, while others considered it 
an indication of decline and nostalgically contemplated past glories. Here are the major key concepts which 
this chapter investigates as they are organized in units: 
 

A. Industrialism and Individualism  
B. Domesticity and the Woman Question 
C. Religion and Evolutionary Theory 
D. The Rise and Fall of the British Empire 
E. Culture and Aesthetics 
F. Victorian Futures 

 

Each unit delves into a major Victorian idea or theme by exploring not only the way it developed 
throughout Victoria’s reign, but also the oppositional voices that were directed against it.

2. The Historical Context 

The Victorian period lasted roughly from 1830 to 1900. It was named after Queen Victoria who sat on the 
throne at the age of eighteen in 1837 and reigned until her death in 1901. Her reign lasted sixty-three years, 
longer than that of any other monarch of the British throne, and included many shifts, breakthroughs, and 
revolutions. As a matter of fact, we might argue that the most prevailing characteristic of the Victorian Age 
were the radical changes that people at the time experienced. These changes are usually grouped into three 
historical stages, each of which has its own unique characteristics and prevalent ideas.  

2. 1 The Early Victorian Period (1830-1858): A Time of Upheavals 

The most defining changes that took place during the early Victorian period were triggered by two major 
revolutions: the Industrial Revolution, which had begun around 1780 but reached its peak during Victoria’s 
reign, and the French Revolution (1789-1815), the revolt of French citizens against monarchy, which also 
broke out at the end of the eighteenth century and deeply affected the political thought of the time throughout 
the western world since it was a forceful manifestation of the power that inheres in the will of the people.  
 First, nearly all facets of everyday life were shaken by the scientific and technological developments 
that the industrial revolution had brought about. Steam engine technology accelerated industrial production 
and helped shape a new class of people who were urbane and entrepreneurial, and whose interests demanded 
less state intervention in business affairs. Accelerated production also resulted in demographic shifts, since the 
driving force of economy was no longer related with farming, but with working and living in industrial 
centers. This practically meant that large numbers of people had to leave the countryside and move to an 
urban setting whose infrastructure could not support such a sudden and unexpected influx of working hands.  
 Moreover, in these new industrial centers, new forms of print culture started to develop through the 
proliferation of newspapers, magazines, journals, novels, and circulating libraries which, along with the 
educational reforms of the period, led to a gradual increase of literacy rates. The growth of the print culture, 
furthermore, satisfied the Victorians’ need to be informed about the radical changes that took place at the

Victorian and Anti-Victorian Voices 
 

time. Such inquisitive spirit was further fueled by technological and scientific advances (science became a 
national hobby, as we shall see), and the facilitation of travel and communication as well. The spread of 
railway lines in the 1830s changed the map of the country, as it shortened distances and brought nearer 
cutaway towns or places which were until then hard to reach. The advances in science and technology also 
helped commerce flourish, a fact which rendered Britain a powerful empire that controlled the world markets.  
 These economic, demographic, technological, and scientific shifts had their political, ideological, 
religious, and cultural repercussions as well. Stimulated by the French Revolution, which inspired peoples 
throughout Europe to claim their rights against the status quo (or the ancient regime, as it was called), 
Victorians reacted against the injustices brought about by industrialization. As a result, the times called for a 
new way of thinking which, however, conflicted with the status quo (the old way of thinking) and so 
upheavals were generated. A typical example of the way new social givens resulted in new political 
formations was the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor that the Industrial Revolution had 
brought about. This widening became a source of political and ideological agitation and soon ignited a 
persistent call for a sweeping reform of the system of political representation. Consequently, after a series of 
demonstrations, strikes and fights with the authorities, the First Reform Bill, through which the newly formed 
industrial centers were represented in parliament, was passed in 1832.  
 The Victorians interpreted these radical changes in conflicting ways: for many, the changes signaled 
progress and advance, heralding hope and optimism; yet for others, they were considered to be a type of 
disease, a spiritual malaise that had to be immediately treated and cured. The Victorian thinkers who were 
systematically engaged with the benefits or the shortcomings of progress were called sages and were actually 
responsible for the flowering of prose during this period.  
  Despite their ideological or stylistic differences, all these sages agreed that this was a time of 
historical rupture, and expressed their deep awareness concerning these shifts as well as their unease about 
their outcome. William Hazlitt (1778-1830) spoke in 1825 about “The Spirit of the Age”; Thomas Carlyle 
(1795-1881) talked in 1829 about the “Signs of the Times” (and in 1831 attempted to define the era’s 
“Characteristics”); John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) also wrote about “The Spirit of the Age” in 1831; and 
Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873) published about England and the English (1833). This was “an age of 
transition,” as J. S. Mill put it in “The Spirit of the Age,” in which “mankind have outgrown old institutions 
and old doctrines, and have not acquired new ones.” Or, as Bulwer-Lytton noted: 
 

We live in an age of transition—an age of disquietude and doubt—of the removal of 
timeworn landmarks, and the breaking up of the hereditary elements of society—old 
opinions, feelings—ancestral customs and institutions are crumbling away, and both the 
spiritual and temporal worlds are darkened by the shadows of change. The commencement 
of one of these epochs—periodical in the history of mankind—is hailed by the sanguine as 
the coming of a new Millennium—a great iconoclastic reformation, by which all false gods 
shall be overthrown. To me such epochs appear 
but as the dark passages in the appointed 
progress of mankind—the times of greatest 
unhappiness to our species—passages into 
which we have no reason to rejoice at our 
entrance, save from the hope of being sooner 
landed on the opposite side.  

2. 2 The Mid-Victorian Period (1848-1870): 
Prosperity and Optimism 

This period is also known as the “Age of Equipoise,” 
because the sense of crisis and disruption of the 1830s 
and 1840s gave its place to optimism and industrial 
supremacy. Progress became the byword of the day 
since the mid-century was a period of unprecedented 
general prosperity. This was the time when Britain 
discovered many new markets across the seas and 

The Great Exhibition:  
 

It was one of the first international fairs, 
organized by Prince Albert and Henry Cole. It 
lasted for five months and was housed in an 
enormous structure made of glass and metal 

located in Hyde Park. One could find on 
display there 13,000 exhibits from Britain 

and its colonies: technological devices, raw 
materials, exotic art, and jewelry, among 

others. The Great Exhibition attracted many 
visitors and heralded an era of technological 
advance and consumerism. It celebrated the 

inauguration of industrial Britain.

became an international Empire. Consequently, it was also the time when Victorian confidence and optimism 
reached its peak. Such optimism was solidified through the Great Exhibition which opened in Hyde Park, 
London, in 1851, and signaled Britain’s scientific and technological sovereignty in the world. The prosperity 
of the times was manifest through the fact that now money and financial problems became prominent topics in 
the novels of the period. Most writers, moreover, turned to historical fiction or the recording of the domestic 
stability of middle class people. The attention of criticism, in a similar manner, shifted from Thomas Carlyle 
and his expression of anxiety about the poor to Matthew Arnold’s concern about the culture of the middle 
classes.  

Furthermore, the fact that many people from different backgrounds and religious practices gathered 
together into cities, meant that many dissenting voices demanded that their rights were equally heard and 
represented, and this gradually undermined the supremacy of the Anglican Church. The status of the Church 
was additionally eroded by evolutionary theory and geology. This practically meant that religious discourses 
were gradually replaced by more rational ones, like the narrative of evolution or Utilitarianism, as we shall 
see. All these changes eventually brought about a deep uncertainty about morals, institutions or values, 
becoming the price, one might argue, Victorians had to pay for progress. Dilemmas, such as tradition or 
progress, science or religion, culture or anarchy, proliferated, engendering even more debates, and 
intensifying the feeling of uncertainty, despite the overall prosperity.  

 

2.3 The Late Victorian Period (1870-1901): Decline and Pessimism 

Throughout the last two decades of the century, all major Victorian writers passed away: George Eliot died in 
1880, Thomas Carlyle in 1881, Dante Gabriel Rossetti in 1882, Anthony Trollope in 1882, Mathew Arnold in 
1888, Wilkie Collins in 1889, Robert Browning in 1889, and Christina Rossetti and Walter Pater in 1894. 
This, along with some other radical changes that took place at the time, made people feel that it really was the 
fin de siècle, that is, the end of the century, or the end of a golden era and the coming of something new, 
which they could not yet define and which aroused fear. Traditional Victorian propriety and earlier optimism 
about progress were now openly questioned as outdated, while the ideals of domesticity, family, and 
earnestness were challenged. This brought about a feeling of uneasiness and anxiety that was enhanced by the 
aftermath of the Darwinian revolution and the radical rationalization it had spread. Darwinism and its 
offshoots gave new prominence and prestige to science, which ultimately triumphed over theology. Sexuality, 
for example, came to be treated as a medical or scientific subject; the status of imperialism was scientifically 
validated; and the arts and cultural movements were aligned with technological or scientific advances. The 
feeling that nothing was fixed or could be taken for granted was prevalent. 
 In the last decades of the century also, technological advances changed profoundly the way literature 
was produced, distributed, or read, affecting the relation between the author and the reader. The Education Act 
of 1870, and the subsequent educational reforms, drastically expanded the reading public by making 
elementary education compulsory. Furthermore, printing and the press became much cheaper and accessible 
to an increasingly literate public that wanted to be constantly informed about this surprising new world. These 
changes established journalism as one of the most dominant powers in the shaping of public opinion. 
Moreover, the expansion of the reading public entailed the incorporation of new reading groups in the market 
that sought new forms of expression. Thus, the growth of the reading market led to the emergence and 
development of new genres like children’s literature, travel literature, pop science, and the short story.  

More than any other genre, the short story was a sign of the times. The traditional and emblematic 
three-decker novel (the three-volume novel) declined in popularity in the last two decades of the century, as 
people no longer read novels through circulating libraries, but bought them. Books had to be cheap and short 
because the pace of life had also changed and leisure time for the middle classes decreased. There were 
authors, like Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) and Arthur Conan Doyle (1858-1930), who were solidly based on 
this new form and made the most of the financial opportunities that the short story afforded them, developing 
an awareness of the needs of the market that previous writers did not have. Likewise, Oscar Wilde (1854-
1900) exploited many different forms of writing that addressed different kinds of readers and always linked

the implied author of his works with his public image as a celebrity, whereas Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-
1894) addressed the specific needs of the market by publishing his most sensational works during Christmas 
in order to increase sales. 

In a strange way, old narratives and viewpoints still lingered, despite the fact that their relevance was 
lost and they urgently had to be replaced with newer ones. The defining characteristic of the end of the 
Victorian era was precisely the paradoxical coexistence of conflicting voices: a growing conservativism was 
accompanied by the rise of feminism, socialism, and the surfacing of dissident sexualities; nationalist or 
imperialist confidence coexisted along with its questioning; the vision of progress brought fears about 
regressing to an uncivilized state; collectivism was juxtaposed to disinterested individualism, tradition to 
innovation, commodification to crafted art, popular and mass art to elite and obscure forms of art. Such 
coexistence of opposing views and concepts was, of course, highly indicative of a radical dissolution of social 
consensus and coherence, and anticipated the diversity and plurality of the Modernist Period.

In Signs of the Times (1829), Thomas Carlyle argues that the defining characteristic of his era is 
mechanization, an unprecedented social phenomenon that affected all aspects of life: from industrial 
production to philosophy, and from cultural production to human relations:

Were we required to characterize this age of ours by any single epithet, we should be 
tempted to call it, not an Heroical, Devotional, Philosophical, or Moral Age, but, above all 
others, the Mechanical Age. It is the Age of Machinery, in every outward and inward sense 
of that word; the age which, with its whole undivided might, forwards, teaches and practices 
the great art of adapting means to ends. Nothing is now done directly, or by hand: all is by 
rule and calculated contrivance, some cunning abbreviating process is in readiness. 

 
The driving force of such mechanization is what Elisabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861) years later will call 
the “plague of gold” and the profound alienation that it brought about. As she admits in “The Cry of the 
Human” (1842): 
 

Our thoughts grow blank, our words grow strange, 
We cheer the pale gold-diggers, 
Each soul is worth so much on Change, 
And marked, like sheep, with figures. (41-44) 

 
Both Browning and Carlyle are alluding here to the 

sweeping force of the Industrial Revolution which started in the 
1780s but gained momentum during the early nineteenth century. 
Britain was one of the first countries to be radically transformed by 
this Revolution due to the fact that its economy could support the 
large-scale investments that such a transformation called for. 
Secondly, after the Glorious Revolution, the anti-absolutist climate 
that was established favored the reduction of State intervention and 
the expansion of commerce, a fact which led to the birth of a 
commercial middle class. There were also certain scientific 
developments such as James Hargreaves’ (1720-1778) spinning 
jenny (1770) or Samuel Crompton’s spinning mule (1779) that 
mechanized weaving production, and James Watt (1736-1819) and 
Matthew Boulton’s (1728-1809) steam engine (1796), which not 
only satisfied the need for increased power supplies, but also 
revolutionized modes of production and resulted in increased mass 
production. Mills no longer depended on waterwheels for power, and steam engines became the driving force 
of coal mines, paving the way for the railroad, which drastically accelerated the speed of production in the 
1830s and 1840s.

Such technological advances deeply affected people’s lives and changed the face of Britain 

profoundly. This was an era of transition when places like Birmingham, Leeds, and Manchester (which was

called “the workshop of the world”) turned from small towns into grey industrial cities. The residents were 
forced to leave behind the rural pace of the farms they used to work on and were subjected to the inhuman 
working conditions of gas-lit factories that turned night into day in order to maximize profit. As a result, the 
English class structure also changed fundamentally. Workers started to develop class consciousness, while the 
middle classes increasingly rose to prominence through the new professions that the industrial revolution 
engendered. The “captains of industry,” as Carlyle calls the new class of industrialists, antagonized aristocracy 
since, unlike upper-class men, they were self-made men who did not rely on their family’s money or property.  

The widening of the gap between the rich and the poor eventually engendered social conflict, and 
became one of the biggest problems of the time. A series of legislations or political changes during the 
following years aimed at alleviating the condition of the poor:  

 
• In the 1830s, official labor unions started to develop, and policies that would improve 

prison and working conditions and education began to be practiced.  
• The air of change that was blowing throughout Europe after the French revolution was 

expressed in Britain through the First Reform Act of 1832. 
• In 1834, the Poor Law Amendment Act was passed. It organized workhouses within which 

the poor and the needy could live and work under a very harsh regime which was meant to 
act as disincentive for those who wanted to live there without producing anything. The 
conditions in these workhouses were severely criticized by many Victorians. Dickens’ 
Oliver Twist (1837-39) is such a striking example.  

• In 1833, the Factory Reform Act was passed which dictated that children under thirteen 
could only work forty-eight hours a week. 

• A series of bad harvests in the 1840s, nevertheless, led to yet more poverty and 
overpopulation, since starving people from Ireland rushed into industrial centers in order to 
find a job, and this inflated food prices. This was probably the most wretched period for the 
poor in the history of England, which is also called the “Hungry Forties.” The overall 
climate resulted in the Repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, that is, the reduction of taxation on 
imported grain, which was meant to protect and increase the incomes of landowners and 
prevent the import of cheap foreign wheat. This practically meant that the Repeal of the 
Corn Laws was one of the first laws that took into serious consideration the poor by 
reducing the profits of the rich landlords. 

 
This time of upheavals, social paradoxes and 

political instabilities is what the Victorians called the 
“Condition of England,” a term initially coined by 
Thomas Carlyle in Chartism (1839). With the phrase “the 
Condition of England” Carlyle did not allude only to the 
new reality of the two nations of the rich and the poor, 
but also to the debates about the role of industrialization 
that were tearing Britain apart, and the anger produced by 
such a profound division of society. What Carlyle also 
wanted to highlight was the fact that the heavy and rapid 
industrialization of British society did not only herald an 
era of prosperity for some, but also signaled a time of 
deep poverty and social agitation, which threatened to 
overthrow traditional institutions and ideals. In his 
analysis of British society on the eve of the “Hungry 
Forties,” Carlyle actually expressed his anxiety about the 
fact that if the situation of the poor would not improve, 
this would have catastrophic consequences on English society, leading to something that everybody would 
regret, i.e., a revolution.

electorate by including new industrial areas 
of the north that did not have the right to 

be represented before. It also gave the vote

worth of 10 pounds and more. This meant 
that one out of 5 men could vote. Women 
and working class people were, of course, 

excluded.

Yannis Kanarakis 

Thomas Carlyle, from Past and Present  
  
In this extract Carlyle, using his characteristic vivid language, defines the “Condition of England.”  
 
The condition of England, on which many pamphlets are now in the course of publication, and many 
thoughts unpublished are going on in every reflective head, is just regarded as one of the most 
ominous, and withal one of the strangest, ever seen in this world. England is full of wealth, of 
multifarious produce, supply for human want in every kind; yet England is dying of inanition. With 
unabated bounty the land of England blooms and grows; Waving with yellow harvests; Thick-
studded with workshops, industrial implements, with fifteen millions of workers, understood to be 
the strongest, the cunningest and the willingest our Earth ever had; These men are here; The work 
they have done, the fruit they have realized is here, abundant, exuberant on every hand of us; And 
behold, some baleful fiat as of Enchantment has gone forth saying, “Touch it not, ye workers, ye 
master-workers, ye master-idlers; None of you can touch it, no man of you shall be the better for it; 
This is enchanted fruit!” On the poor workers such fiat falls first, in its rudest shape; But on the rich 
the master-workers too it falls; Neither can the rich master-idlers, nor any richest or highest man 
escape, but all are like to be brought low with it, and made “poor” enough in the money sense or a 
far fataller one. 

 

Benjamin Disraeli, from Sybil, or, The Two Nations 
 
This extract describes the division of England into “two nations,” the rich and the poor.  
 

Book II, Chapter 5, The Two Nations 
 
“It is a community of purpose that constitutes society,” continued the younger stranger; “without 
that, men may be drawn into contiguity, but they still continue virtually isolated.”  
 “And is that their condition in cities?” 
 “It is their condition everywhere; But in cities that condition is aggravated. A density of 
population implies a severer struggle for existence, and a consequent repulsion of elements brought 
into too close contact. In great cities men are brought together by the desire of gain. They are not in a 
state of co-operation, but of isolation, as to the making of fortunes; And for all the rest they are 
careless of neighbours. Christianity teaches us to love our neighbor as oneself; Modern society 
acknowledges no neighbor.” 
 “Well, we live in strange times,” said Ergemont, struck by the observation of his companion, and 
relieving a perplexed spirit by an ordinary exclamation, which often denotes that the mind is more 
stirred than it cares to acknowledge, or at the moment is able to express. 
 “When the infant begins to walk, it also thinks that it lives in strange times,” said his companion. 
 “Your inference?” asked Ergemont. 
 “That society, still in its infancy, is beginning to feel its way.” 
 “This is a new reign,” said Ergemont, “Perhaps it is a new era.” 
 “I think so,” said the younger stranger. 
 “I hope so,” said the elder one. 
 “Well, society may be in its infancy,” said Ergemont, slightly smiling, “but, say what you like, 
our Queen reigns over the greatest nation ever existed.” 
 “Which nation?” asked the younger stranger, “for she reigns over two.” 
 The stranger paused; Ergemont was silent, but looked inquiringly. 
 “Yes,” resumed the younger stranger after a moment’s interval. “Two nations; Between whom 
there is no intercourse and no sympathy; Who are as ignorant of each other’s habits, thoughts, and

feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets; Who are 
formed by a different breeding, are fed by a different food, are ordered by different manners, and are 
not governed by the same laws.” 
 “You speak of _______” said Ergemont, hesitatingly. 
 “THE RICH AND THE POOR.” 

3.2 The Social Problem Novel 

The wretchedness of the poor was documented by many philosophers and writers of the time as a new and 
shocking phenomenon. Perhaps one of the most disturbing recordings of working-class life appears in the 
study of the German philosopher Friedrich Engels (1820-1895), The Condition of the Working Classes in 
England (1845). The effects of industrialism on the masses was a debatable topic which was, furthermore, 
explored and portrayed in the Condition of England novel or Industrial novel, or social problem novel, which 
came to prominence during that time. In most cases, these novels sought to reconcile or bridge the inequalities 
that the industrial revolution brought about. Novels that belong in this tradition are, among others, France 
Trollope’s The Life and Adventure of Michael Armstrong, the Factory Boy (1840), Benjamin Disraeli’s 
Coningsky (1844) and Sybil, or The Two Nations (1846), Elisabeth Gaskell’s Mary Barton (1848) and North 
and South (1855), Charlotte Brontë’s Shirley (1849), Charles Kingsley’s Alton Locke (1850) and Charles 
Dickens’ Hard Times (1854).  

Most of these novels are either based on first-hand experience or official documents and records, such 
as parliamentary reports or extracts from the press. For example, Benjamin Disraeli’s Sybil heavily relies on 
the 1842 report of the Children’s Employment Commission and the 1843 report on the payment of wages. Set 
during the years of political agitation in the 1830s, Sybil draws on Parliamentary reports in order to illustrate 
factory conditions, and draw attention to the gap between the rich and the poor, which were like two different 
nations. Dickens’ Hard Times (1854) is based on the author’s personal investigation of the cotton workers’ 
strike in Preston, Lancashire. In Mary Barton (1848) and North and South (1855), Elisabeth Gaskell presents 
the bleak reality of industrial neighborhoods, modeled on real Manchester slums. Mary Barton, set during the 
turbulent 1830s, documents Gaskell’s first-hand experiences from industrial Manchester. There is a strong 
ethnographic undercurrent in the novel that tries to capture the local dialect and the workers’ customs in order 
to sketch the plight of the people living there. Both Frances Trollope and Elisabeth Gaskell, in their prefaces 
to Michael Armstrong and Mary Barton respectively, express their wish to inform the reading public about the 
embarrassing living and working conditions of the working classes. In Trollope’s The Life and Adventures of 
Michael Armstrong, the Factory Boy (1840), the charitable heroine Mary Brotherton considers it her moral 
obligation to be informed about the poor, while the author exposes the reader to the child-labour conditions of 
Manchester and Bradford. In a similar fashion, Charlotte Brontë in Shirley (1849) illustrates the complex 
socio-political and historical factors that led to the workers’ plight.  

 

Friedrich Engels, from The Condition of the Working Class in England 
 
In this extract, Engels describes the individualism of the working people in the slums. 
 
The crowd by one another as though they had nothing in common, nothing to do with one another, 
and their only agreement is the tacit one, that each keep to his own side of the pavement, so as not to 
delay the opposing streams of the crowd, while it occurs to no man to honour another with so much 
as a glance. The brutal indifference, the unfeeling isolation of each in his private interest becomes the 
more repellent and offensive, the more these individuals are crowded together, within a limited 
space. 

Most of these writers recorded the bleak reality of industrialism as a means of introducing something 
new to the middle classes, adopting the role of a reporter, historian or even social scientist. But the political 

59 
 



Yannis Kanarakis 

perspective from which they regarded this bleak aspect of British society was more than evident: Disraeli was 
a conservative, Gaskell a dissenter, and Dickens a distanced southerner. They had nothing to do, in other 
words, with the harsh reality that the workers faced. This means that all these writers were not only writing for 
the middle classes, but they were writing from a middle class standpoint as well, simultaneously promoting a 
middle class morality in their work. This tendency was in tune with the strong moral tone within which the 
Condition of England was presented by authors like Marx, Engels, Ruskin, and Carlyle, who all considered it 
a moral obligation of the individual to be aware of the circumstances in which large communities of people 
spent their lives. This moral perspective was due to the fact that for these writers the plights of the poor were 
an offshoot of the nation’s progress, industrialism and individualism, so the middle class individual, who 
reaped the benefits of such progress was implicitly held morally responsible for the fate of the poor. In this 
light, all these Victorian writers also addressed the issue of the relation between the individual and the 
community, and depicted how individuals are always shaped and defined through their relation with the 
community. This preoccupation with the relation between the individual and community will later develop 
into what is probably the most defining issue of the Victorian novel. 

 
 

  
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

3.3 Victorian Individualism and Collectivism 

The driving force of industrialism was individualistic competitiveness and self-interestedness. Let us not 
forget here that although this was the first time more than half of the population was living in industrial cities, 
the sense of community was lost when people had to leave the villages and move into factory towns. 
Furthermore, the new industrial reality was considered by many as a jungle where people had to struggle hard 
for survival. This idea was also promoted through the new class of the industrialists, a novel role model, in the 
sense that they signaled a new type of self-made man who managed to make it on his own without having to 
rely on his family’s money, fortune, or name. Moreover, there were also certain political events that 
substantiated the doctrine of individualism. One such case was the Anti-Corn Law League which, based on 
laissez-faire (free trade) principles, demanded the import of cheap wheat in order to keep wages low and 
increase the export of cotton. The Repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was actually a triumph of the laissez-faire 
ideology of self-interestedness, as well. What is more, after the Municipal Reform Act of 1835, 
Nonconformists (i.e., dissenters from the established church of England) could enter local government. These 
people manifested a strong individualistic ideology because their creed allowed them to be opposed to 
religious authorities. As they followed their conscience, they could easily dissent not only from local 
authorities but from state interference as well, and promote a type of ideology that was in full accordance with 
laissez-faire economy.  

Self-reliance and individualism gradually became one of the most dominant and characteristic middle 
class Victorian values. This is why when Samuel Smiles, the Scottish government reformer, published his 
book tellingly entitled Self Help with Illustrations of Conduct and Perseverance (1859), it became a huge 
best-seller. It is precisely the prevalent idea of individualism and the ideology of self-help as a means of

economic success that Charles Dickens ridicules in Hard Times (1854) through the character of Bounderby, a 
supposedly self-made industry owner, who is eventually proved to be a scoundrel. 

 

Samuel Smiles, from Self Help with Illustrations of Conduct and Perseverance 
 
Daily experience shows that it is energetic individualism which produces the most powerful effects 
upon the life and action of others, and really constitutes the best practical education. Schools, 
academies, and colleges, give but the merest beginnings of culture in comparison with it. Far more 
influential is the life-education daily given in our homes, in the streets, behind counters, in 
workshops, at the loom and the plough, in counting-houses and manufactories, and in the busy 
haunts of men. This is that finishing instruction as members of society, which Schiller designated 
“the education of the human race,” consisting in action, conduct, self-culture, self-control,—all that 
tends to discipline a man truly, and fit him for the proper performance of the duties and business of 
life,—a kind of education not to be learnt from books, or acquired by any amount of mere literary 
training. 

 
In fact, what actually lurked behind individualism was nothing else but the laissez-faire politics that 

industrialism was solidly based upon. The ideology of laissez-faire was also promoted by Utilitarianism, 
Benthamism, or Philosophical Radicalism, the philosophical and economic movement founded by Jeremy 
Bentham (1748-1832) which greatly affected the legal, social, political, and economic thought of the time. 
Bentham’s system was based on the idea that the leading principle in people’s lives is the desire to avoid pain 
and seek pleasure; consequently, all laws had to promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number. 
Bentham’s theory, in other words, was implicitly aligned with the laissez-faire individualism of Adam Smith 
(1723-1790), since it basically opposed any type of state interference so that people would be free to pursue 
their own interests, and, by doing so, promote general welfare. For Bentham, the role of the state had to be 
reduced to national defense and the protection of private property and public order.  

Along with the development of individualism there grew a strong reaction to it. The strongest and 
most fervent early critic of Victorian individualism and rationalism was Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881). We 
should note here, however, that Carlyle may have attacked the individualism implicit in laissez-faire 
economy, yet his version of history revolved around the lives of unique individuals. In this way, Carlyle was 
indirectly favoring a different type of individualism related with the charismatic leader who was in favor of 
the common good, rather than his [sic] personal interest. In his 1840 series of lectures entitled On Heroes, 
Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History, Carlyle celebrated the power of human agency, arguing that the 
concept of individualism was crucial even for those who were partially against it and comprised one of the 
cornerstones of Victorian ideology.  

One of the most influential forms of collectivity that rose to prominence at the time was the political 
movement of Chartism, which came into sharp contrast with what individualism stood for.  

  

Chartism and Its Legacy  
 
Chartism was one of the strongest and most widespread working-class movements that Britain had 
ever known, despite the fact that it was a very short-lived phenomenon that lasted from 1838 to 
1848. Chartism asked for constitutional reform and the democratization of politics. In his pamphlet 
published in 1839, Carlyle describes it as the symptom of an illness that might radically undermine 
social stability and order. It was an outgrowth of the political and economic predicaments of the time 
and the disillusionment that followed the inequalities of the first Reform Bill of 1832. Through this 
movement, workers protested against their low wages, the unacceptable working conditions, and the 
widening of the gulf between the rich and the poor. The movement took its name from the “People’s 
Charter” that William Lovett and Francis Place drew up in 1838, and which included the celebrated 

61 
 



Yannis Kanarakis 

six points: universal male suffrage, equal electoral districts, removal of property qualifications for 
MPs, payment for MPs, secret ballots, and annual elections.  

Chartists fully utilized the printing technology of the time in order to spread their political 
agenda, which was expressed in songs, chants, ballads, and hymns. Thus, there were many chartist 
papers or magazines, like The Labourer, The Chartist Circular, or The Northern Star, the official 
chartist organ, which published poems by chartist poets like Thomas Cooper, Gerald Massey, Ernest 
Jones, or W. J. Linton. After having gathered nearly 1.5 million signatures, in 1839 the chartists 
submitted a petition to the Parliament, but it was rejected. The rejection was followed by many 
demonstrations and government counter-actions. These events were actually the historical 
background against which Disraeli’s Sybil and Gaskell’s Mary Barton were set. In 1842, a second 
petition was presented, followed in 1848 by a third one, both of which were also rejected, leading to 
strikes and riots, which formed the background of Kingsley’s novel Alton Locke. The disillusionment 
and the riots that followed, the fact that the middle classes turned to trade unionism, along with the 
prosperity of the subsequent years, led to the waning of the chartist power.  

By 1848, Chartism had lost its impetus, but its presence could be felt throughout the century 
as a reaction to the radical changes that industrialization had brought about and the inequalities it had 
generated. Most of the six points of the People’s Charter were in due course incorporated in the 
English constitution, while Chartism helped radicalism turn into socialism in the following decades. 
It definitely paved the way for the improvement of factory conditions and child-labor. It also 
heralded the rise of class-consciousness which is evident in Dickens’ novels David Copperfield and 
Great Expectations.  

When, years later, a persistent agricultural depression in the 1870s resulted in economic 
depression, unemployment, and poverty in 1884, there followed general public agitation and a 
resurfacing of Chartism. This alarmed the authorities and led to the awareness that a new handling of 
urban poverty was needed which prompted a series of state interventions, new reforms, and debates 
that signaled the birth of social welfare. A new collective awareness was developed then as a form of 
dissatisfaction with the dominant trend of individualism. This was also the time when socialism and 
collectivism became very popular through the foundation of many organizations such as the Socialist 
League (1883) or the Fabian Society (1884).

The dilemmas and anxieties concerning the phenomenon of Chartism were recorded in the novels of 
the time through characters of working class men and women who rejected the bleak individualism of laissez-
faire by joining collective groups such as trade unions or Chartism. These collectivities were, nevertheless, 
threatening the established order, since they brought back memories of the horrors of the French Revolution. 
As Carlyle confessed in “Chartism,” “[t]hese Chartisms, Radicalisms, Reform Bill are our French Revolution; 
God grant that we, with our better methods, may be able to transact it by arguments alone.” Such threat was 
dramatized in the literature of the time through the persistent positive illustrations of individual workers and 
negative depiction of organized evil workers. Despite the fact that all social-problem writers sympathized 
initially with the newly risen working class, when this class started claiming its rights and questioning the 
established distribution of wealth, sympathy gave way to fear and horror. 

In Dickens’ Hard Times, for instance, the workers of industrial Coketown are presented as a single 
anonymous and uniform body, whereas the character of Stephen Blackpool embodies the worker who 
maintains his individuality by refusing to join their union. In a similar fashion, Gaskell’s novels stage 
suspicion and fear in the face of organized workers, whereas Hard Times, Shirley, and Sybil harshly condemn 
trade unions. In Mary Barton, the poor are presented as monsters, whereas in North and South they are 
illustrated in bestial terms. Trade unions and working collectivities are, moreover, regarded as hindrances to 
economic progress. In Alton Locke and Mary Barton, chartists are directly and unquestionably held 
responsible for outbreaks of political violence and are considered to be its initiators, revealing the social 
distrust that chartists and the poor evoked for the middle classes. The portrayal of Chartism is even more 
negative in Benjamin Disraeli’s Sybil, or The Two Nations (1845), as becomes evident in the famous scene 
where the mob attacks Mowbray Castle, overtly evoking memories of the French Revolution. In Charles 
Kingsley’s Alton Locke, Tailor and Poet (1850), Chartism is also presented as a negative influence and a 
means of losing one’s individual traits by becoming part of an uncontrollably violent mob. All these novels 
depict how extremist agitators take advantage of the bad working and living conditions of the workers and 
their ignorance in order to spread destructive mob anarchy and undermine social order.  

It is interesting to note here that most of these writers resorted to novelistic and romance conventions 
in order to overcome the ideological shortcomings or impasses of their plots. All these industrial novels have 
strong intrusive narrators that directly address the reader in order to consolidate their didactic tone and direct 
the reader’s response to such complicated social phenomena. The emphasis on didacticism can be considered 
an early precursor of the attempt to educate and shape the opinion of the middle class, something which 
became a central issue in the mid-Victorian period, as we will see.  

Apart from the didacticism of the omniscient narrators, writers employed other literary conventions in 
order to provide solutions to political problems. The gap between the two nations, the rich and the poor, in 
these novels is not resolved by overthrowing the status quo but rather through an unexpected inheritance, the 
revelation of blood kinship, or marriage. The fact, moreover, that all these authors yearned for a solution to 
the social problem reflects their desire for social stability and the annihilation of anything that might disrupt it. 
Thus, what initially sets out to be a social, economic, or ideological problem is soon resolved through an 
idiom of harmony and reconciliation that actually serves to maintain the status quo. In Disraeli’s Sybil, the 
answer to the Chartist agitation and the threatening rise of a new class is provided through the marriage 
between Charles Egremont, the industrialist, and Sybil, who, together with her father, the Chartist leader, turn 
out to be aristocrats. For Disraeli, the gap between the two nations can only be bridged through a new form of 
aristocracy, embodied in the marriage between the heroine and Egremont, and not through trade unions or 
chartists. Drawing heavily on Carlyle’s version of heroism, Disraeli promotes in his novel a new form of 
aristocratic chivalry that would lead the people and establish a historical continuity with the ancient regime. 
Aristocracy, monarchy, the Church, and workers are harmonized in an overtly non-democratic way, since the 
new working classes are left totally unrepresented in the final resolution.  

In a similar fashion, in Gaskell’s Mary Barton, the initial careful representation of social inequalities 
of the first part of the book is abruptly substituted by a romance plot and sensationalist fiction conventions. It 
seems that Gaskell’s sympathy towards social issues reaches an impasse when it clashes with her middle class 
Christian identity. Resorting to the convention of the marriage plot, Gaskell naively suggests that love can 
achieve the reconciliation between the two nations or at least soften the tension between them.

3.4 Individualism and Poetry: The Dramatic Monologue 

The force of individualistic ideology was not only manifest in the industrial novels of the time, but found 
expression in other literary forms, such as the dramatic monologue, which was one of the most fashionable 
poetic modes during the Victorian period. This poetic tradition was invented, practiced, and popularized by 
Alfred Tennyson, Robert Browning, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and various other Victorian poets. It based its 
effect on theatrical qualities since it involved an imagined speaker and an implied audience. A dramatic 
monologue focused on a person’s speech which was open to interpretation by the audience without any direct 
authorial intervention. In most cases, this speech highlighted a form of discrepancy between what the speaker 
or persona said and what s/he meant or how the audience interpreted it. As such, this medium was a perfect 
means of illustrating the complexities of human identity through the active participation of the audience or the 
listener. This medium was very popular at the time because it addressed the conflicts and discrepancies 
between the personal and the social that were very much in the air. In other words, it implicitly illustrated the 
shortcomings of individualism by highlighting the active role of the audience in the construction of social 
reality or meaning. It achieved this by staging individuals who have no knowledge of their blind-spots and 
whose self-centeredness is the reason why they are self-deluded. The fact that the audience is aware of their 
delusions, nevertheless, generates dramatic irony. In a similar fashion, Tennyson’s “The Lady of Shalott” 
(1832) captures the tension between personal inner vision and the realm of social demand, whereas in “The 
Lotus-Eaters” (1832) Tennyson lucidly encapsulates the conflict between desire and duty.  

In one of Robert Browning’s (1812-1889) most celebrated dramatic monologues, “The Bishop Orders 
His Tomb at Saint Praxed’s Church” (1845), for example, the nuances of individualism are implicitly invoked 
through a portrait of a fictional Renaissance bishop on his deathbed ordering his tomb. Browning draws on the 
theatrical conventions of the dramatic monologue in order to illustrate the clash between the reader’s or the 
audience’s expectations for compliance with moral and social norms and the bishop’s self-centeredness. From 
the start, the poem’s unrhymed iambic pentameter, which resembles the rhythm of natural speech, a very 
colloquial and businesslike tone, foregrounds the bishop’s materialism and sensualism rather than his longing 
for salvation, faith, or deliverance. The speaker’s self-centeredness is highlighted not only through his 
indulgences in the poem but also through the fact that he longs to build his luxurious tomb because he wants 
to outshine his antagonist, Old Gandolf. In full compliance with the critics of laissez-faire antagonism, 
Browning presents individualism as a synonym of materialism, envious competitiveness, and shallowness as 
well as the opposite of spirituality, sympathy, or personal fulfillment.

3.5 The Self and the Community in Victorian Fiction  

The idea of overcoming the limitations of the self and becoming one with the community, that is, the idea of 
sympathy through which self-interestedness and greed will be overcome is another crucial Victorian concern 
and one of the dominant themes in Dickens’s work throughout his career. When he visited Manchester in 
1843, Dickens was struck by the volunteers who taught the workers’ children. This very idea of sympathy and 
love able to transcend “the cash nexus” (i.e., materialism) is staged later that year in his very popular story A 
Christmas Carol (1843). Throughout his works, Dickens consistently employs the medium of sentiment as a 
means of teaching his readers how sympathy and love can overcome the limitations of individualism. 
Consider for example Little Nell, the angelic orphan girl in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), whose life is 
immersed in misery while her guardian grandfather is addicted to gambling. Her tragic deathbed scene 
affected the Victorians much more than any other piece of writing and urged them towards social action. 
 Many other Victorian writers were also preoccupied with the relation between the individual and 
society, turning against the dominant ideology of individualism. One might even argue that the main topic of 
the Victorian novel is actually the relation between the self and society. George Eliot addresses this issue 
through the phenomenon of egoism that she is constantly preoccupied with throughout her work. She 
consistently explores the interdependence of the individual and the community through characters who have 
to surpass their individual limitations in order to become helpful to the community. In one of her early works, 
Adam Bede (1859), the character of Dinah Morris is the epitome of altruism, and influences everyone around 
her. In The Mill on the Floss (1860), the community is upheld over and above the self; Maggie Tulliver 
develops from being self-centered to being altruistic and only then can she be united with her brother. In 
Romola (1862-63), through the characters of Tito and Romola, Eliot explores the relation between selfishness 
and generosity. In Middlemarch (1871-72), finally, the narrator illustrates how individual benevolence can 
affect the community.  

In Middlemarch, specifically, the power that brings everything together, does not lie with the 
positivists, Lydgate and Casaubon, who are satirically presented as trying to unify things through biology and 
anthropology, but through an artist, Will Ladislaw, who is the bearer of imagination, or fancy, as Dickens 
would have put it. This is precisely why Eliot employs one of the predominant images in the novel, that of the 
web, to illustrate the idea of interconnectedness. Eliot is preoccupied with extending the sympathies of her 
readers through imagination, the power of identifying with others, and this is why her moralizing narrator 
constantly intervenes to make sure the reader is aware of the connections between her narrative and real life, 
or the reader and the world. The plight of others is, in this way, consistently utilized as a stepping stone for 
action and an urge against egoism. 

The Victorian interest in the relationship between the individual and the collective as a corrective of 
the extremities of self-interestedness is manifested in the resurgence of the bildungsroman (i.e., the novel of 
development or education). Even though the form is solidly based on autobiographical conventions and the 
Romantic tradition of individualism, in the bildungsroman, this emphasis on the individual is always mediated 
through the social and the communal. Identity is here shaped by external social forces and is, as a 
consequence, unstable. In Great Expectations, which is yet another moral fable written by Dickens in the form 
of a bildungsroman, the author is engaged with the impact of social mobility upon the self. The novel 
indicatively begins with Pip’s attempt to understand who he is by trying to read the inscriptions on his 
family’s tombstone. The semi-Gothic atmosphere of the novel is related to the dark quest into “the identity of 
things” (Great Expectations, Vol. 1, Ch. 1) amidst a terrifying world of conflicting and misleading signs. The 
novel includes many scenes of the attempt to to read or write as a means of creating one’s identity, and 
constantly highlights the role of the past in the construction of oneself. The past is the one thing that the 
characters in the novel can never escape from. It is actually only when the protagonist accepts and embraces 
his dark, criminal stepfather that he is able to go up the social ladder and succeed in the competitive world of 
Victorian England. This is how Dickens chose to illustrate the fact that the individual always needs the others 
in order to be complete.

3.6 Escaping Industrialism: The Return to the Past and Medievalism 

 
Image 2.5 Ford Madox Brown. The Seeds and Fruits of English Poetry (1845). 

 
The wretched conditions that the poor had to undergo and the bleak side of industrialization made many 
Victorian thinkers and writers resort to a glorified type of the past as a means of escaping the ugliness of the 
present. George Eliot’s novels, for example, are all marked by a nostalgia for a pre-industrial past. In Adam 
Bebe (1859), The Mill on the Floss (1860), Silas Marner (1861), and Middlemarch (1872) industrialization is 
totally absent despite the fact that Middlemarch, for example, is set against the backdrop of the first Reform 
Bill of 1832. In the opening pages of Felix Holt (1867), Eliot nostalgically contemplates a pastoral past when 
there were no railroads. The need to return to the past is evident in a number Victorian writers and artists; 
Tennyson and Ruskin are nostalgic of the Middle Ages; Robert Browning, Walter Pater and the Pre-
Raphaelite Brotherhood celebrate the art of the late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance; and Matthew 
Arnold longs to revisit classical Greece. Such nostalgia was symptomatic of a refusal to directly engage with 
the present by escaping or sublimating it.  
 Another reason why many writers turned to a glorified and idealized version of the Middle Ages was 
because they wanted to criticize certain aspects of the present. Medievalism was first expressed in the 
eighteenth-century architectural movement of Gothic revival and aimed to highlight a sense of historical 
continuity. The restoration of the Parliament in a Gothic style after it was burned down in 1834 was indicative 
of the type of the non-classical past it wanted to evoke. But it was actually Carlyle’s Past and Present (1843), 
which popularized medievalism by juxtaposing its communal vision to laissez-faire individualism. In this 
book, which is one of the most influential works of Victorian social criticism, Carlyle tries to explore the 
reasons why people do not react against the inequalities and injustice of modern life but rather take them for 
granted. For Carlyle, social bonds have been replaced by the “cash nexus” and reduced to the worship of 
money and material goods. The aristocracy, Carlyle maintains, has failed to provide people with inspiring role 
models that would encourage them to get out of such misery. So, he believes that industrialists, these 
successful self-made men, should take the place of aristocracy and become the “Captains of Industry,” in 

67 
 



Yannis Kanarakis 

order to provide moral guidance to workers and the middle class. Carlyle’s solution draws on a type of 
medieval chivalry in order to come up with a modern type of hero. His answer to the workers’ plight is 
actually a return to a form of feudalism that actually promotes existing social hierarchies and economic 
structures. The promotion of aristocratic political dominance inspired the conservative party, the Tories, and 
deeply influenced Benjamin Disraeli, as we have seen.  
 What is also interesting to note here is that the medieval past was employed to serve diverse 
ideological ends and not only conservative ones. For example Ruskin’s essay “The Nature of Gothic,” in the 
fifth volume of Modern Painters (1860), is solidly based on Carlyle’s medievalist tradition. However, it 
further expands the notion of medievalism to include not only the concept of chivalric pre-industrial, non-
alienated labor, but also the freedom of expression and imagination which industrial mass production 
definitely lacked. Such celebration of handicraft will later have a huge impact on William Morris’ socialism 
and the arts and crafts movement. It will also help shape a whole tradition of utopian fiction in which 
medievalism will be utilized as a means of illustrating an unattainable utopian kind of communal future. This 
is evident in novels such as William Morris’ News from Nowhere (1891) or George Gissing’s Workers in the 
Dawn (1880), Demos (1886) and The Nether World (1889).

4. Domesticity and the Woman Question 

Domestic propriety became one of the most characteristic values of the Victorian temper and was espoused by 
the Queen herself. Women were identified with domestic morality as its guardians and bearers, whereas men 
were identified with the public sphere. Gradually, though, a number of women were not satisfied with the 
domestic role they were called to play, as it was too constraining and even suffocating. Their attempt to 
escape the limitations of the domestic sphere marks the birth of a proto-feminist awareness which comprised a 
crucial part of the Victorian agenda of political and social reformation.  

4.1 Two Separate Spheres: The Cult of Domesticity 

Anne Brontë, “Domestic Peace,” 1850 
 
Why should such gloomy silence reign, 
And why is all the house so drear, 
When neither danger, sickness, pain, 
Nor death, nor want have entered here? 
We are as many as we were  
That other night, when all were gay 
And full of hope, and free from care; 
Yet, is there something gone away. 
The moon without, as pure and calm, 
Is shining, as that night she shone;  
But now, to us, she brings no balm, 
For something from our hearts is gone. 
Something whose absence leaves a void— 
A cheerless want in every heart; 
Each feels the bliss of all destroyed,  
And mourns the change—but each apart. 
The fire is burning in the grate 
As redly as it used to burn; 
But still the hearth is desolate, 
Till mirth, and love, and peace return.  
’T was peace that flowed from heart to heart, 
With looks and smiles that spoke of heaven, 
And gave us language to impart 
The blissful thoughts itself had given. 
Domestic peace! best joy of earth,  
When shall we all thy value learn? 
White angel—to our sorrowing hearth, 
Return—oh, graciously return! 

 
The cult of domesticity functioned at first as a protective shield the Victorians raised against the sweeping 
shifts of the times. Amidst the chaos brought about by radical socioeconomic changes, the idea of ordered and 
pious domesticity was presented as an antidote to such disorder. Home became the shelter from all these 
troubles that seemed to be threatening nearly all aspects of daily life, and women were the guardian angels of 
morality. This feminized version of domesticity was also historically enhanced by the ascension of a young 
female monarch to the throne in 1837. Queen Victoria was devoted not only to her public role, but her 
domestic role too as a loyal wife and mother of nine children, and foregrounded the role of women as the 
bearers of the nation’s morality. In 1839, Sarah Stickney Ellis, the author of multiple books about women’s 

69 
 



Yannis Kanarakis 

roles in society, further popularized the idea of “separate spheres” for men and women and highlighted 
women’s supportive role in the family. Through her publications, she insisted that women should be confined 
to the domestic sphere in order to be able to care for their husbands who toiled in the turbulent public sphere. 
Women were identified with the ideals of home and were considered to be emotional, melancholic, and 
sensitive. 
 

 
Image 2.6 Miss Day, Photograph of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert (26 July 1859). 

  
These domestic traits actually enabled the association of women with art and culture. Interestingly, 

poetry started to be increasingly associated with femininity. Actually, the first two Victorian poets, long 
before Lord Alfred Tennyson appeared on the scene, were Felicia Hemans and Letitia Landon. Hemans was 
one of the most popular early Victorian poets and a leading figure in the domestication of English poetry. 
Most of her work dealt with the idea of home, associated either with family or with England. Landon’s poems, 
on the other hand, are mostly preoccupied with unfulfilled desire and the isolation that female writers 
experienced. The image of a domesticated woman who is sullen or melancholic due to her alienation from the 
public sphere became a defining characteristic of Tennyson’s work. It is a theme he returns to in a number of 
poems, such as “Oenone,” (1829), “The Palace of Art” (1832), and “The Lady of Shalott” (1832), or 
“Mariana” (1830).  

The genre of the novel also contributed decisively to the dissemination of the ideal of domesticity. As 
a matter of fact, this was the time when, gradually but steadily, the novel replaced poetry in popularity and 
became the dominant literary form in the nineteenth century. It should be noted that, unlike previous dominant 
literary forms, that is poetry and drama, the novel was not a collective or public medium, but involved reading 
in the privacy of one’s home. In this sense, the novel was the cultural form of domesticity par excellence. This 
is why most novels involved narratives that had to do with concepts of domesticity such as the family or the 
home. In these novels, the protagonists were usually women, unlike the common literary modes of the past, 
like the epic, which dealt with the public sphere and focused mostly on men. The prevalence of domestic 
ideals in the fiction of the time is also obvious in the work of the most popular Victorian writer, Charles 
Dickens. In nearly all of his stories, Dickens counterbalanced the threatening injustice and violence of the 
public sphere with the soothing moral warmth of home. The domestic sphere is consistently illustrated in 
Dickens as the haven against the difficulties of life.  

In the social-problem novels of the time, moreover, it is often the female protagonist who is the bearer 
of a redemptive and reconciliatory force precisely because of her association with the domestic sphere. Here, 
femininity is identified with the domestic values of love and compassion which are employed in order to 

70 
 



Victorian and Anti-Victorian Voices 
 

soften the political and economic forces of the public sphere with a kind of moral, emotional, and spiritual 
authority. In Benjamin Disraeli’s Sybil, for example, the heroine stands for the sacred and the noble, whereas 
in Elizabeth Gaskell’s Mary Barton and North and South the female protagonists redeem male power through 
their loving. It is the consciousness of Margaret Hale that gives coherence to the universe of North and South 
the way a mother brings a family together. The female as a motherly mediating force brings extremes together 
into a happily-ever-after resolution. Thus, through the marriage plot between Margaret Hale and Henry 
Thorton, male capitalist individualism is feminized and Christianized in order to give birth to a commercial 
middle glass that will replace a declining immoral gentry.  

 

Sarah Stickney Ellis, from The Women of England 
 
In this extract Sarah Stickney Ellis discusses the influence that women in Victorian England have. 
 
It is therefore not only false in reasoning, but wrong in principle, for women to assert, as they not 
unfrequently do with a degree of puerile satisfaction, that they have no influence. 

An influence fraught either with good or evil, they must have; and though the one may be above 
their ambition, and the other beyond their fears, by neglecting to obtain an influence which shall be 
beneficial to society, they necessarily assume a bad one: just in the same proportion as their 
selfishness, indolence, or vacuity of mind, render them in youth an easy prey to every species of 
unamiable temper, in middle age the melancholy victims of mental disease, and, long before the 
curtain of death conceals their follies from the world, a burden and a bane to society at large. A 
superficial observer might with this class many of those exemplary women, who pass to and fro upon 
the earth with noiseless step, whose names are never heard, and who, even in society, if they attempt 
to speak, have scarcely the ability to command an attentive audience. Yet amongst this unpretending 
class are found striking and noble instances of women, who, apparently feeble and insignificant, 
when called into action by pressing and peculiar circumstances, can accomplish great and glorious 
purposes, supported and carried forward by that most valuable of all faculties—moral power. 

It is not to be presumed that women possess more power than men; but happily for them, such are 
their early impressions, associations, and general position in the world, that their moral feelings are 
less liable to be impaired by the pecuniary objects which too often constitute the chief end of man, 
and which, even under the limitations of better principle, necessarily engage a large portion of his 
thoughts. There are many humble-minded women, not remarkable for any particular intellectual 
endowments, who yet possess so clear a sense of the right and wrong of individual actions, as to be 
of essential service in aiding the judgments of their husbands, brothers, or sons, in those intricate 
affairs in which it is sometimes difficult to dissever worldly wisdom from religious duty. 

To men belongs the potent (I had almost said the omnipotent) consideration of worldly 
aggrandisement; and it is constantly misleading their steps, closing their ears against the voice of 
conscience, and beguiling them with the promise of peace, where peace was never found. Long 
before the boy has learned to exult in the dignity of the man, his mind has become familiarized to the 
habit of investing with supreme importance, all considerations relating to the acquisition of wealth. 
He hears on the sabbath, and on stated occasions, when men meet for that especial purpose, of a God 
to be worshipped, a Saviour to be trusted in, and a holy law to be observed; but he sees before him, 
every day and every hour, a strife, which is nothing less than deadly to the highest impulses of the 
soul, after another god—the mammon of unrighteousness—the moloch3 of this world; and believing 
rather what men do, than what they preach, he learns too soon to mingle with the living mass, and to 
unite his labours with theirs. To unite? Alas! there is no union in the great field of action in which he 
is engaged; but envy and hatred, and opposition, to the close of the day. . . . 

How often has man returned to his home with a mind confused by the many voices, which in the 
mart, the exchange, or the public assembly, have addressed themselves to his inborn selfishness, or 
his worldly pride; and while his integrity was shaken, and his resolution gave way beneath the 
pressure of apparent necessity, or the insidious pretences of expediency, he has stood corrected 
before the clear eye of woman, as it looked directly to the naked truth, and detected the lurking evil 
of the specious act he was about to commit. 

71 
 



Yannis Kanarakis 

Nay, so potent may have become this secret influence, that he may have borne it about with him 
like a kind of second conscience, for mental reference, and spiritual counsel in moments of trial; and 
when the snares of the world were around him, and temptations from within and without have bribed 
over the witness in his own bosom, he has thought of the humble monitress who sat alone, guarding 
the fireside comforts of his distant home; and the remembrance of her character, clothed in moral 
beauty, has scattered the clouds before his mental vision, and sent him back to that beloved home, a 
wiser and a better man.

Apart from evolutionary theory, which launched a relentless questioning of religious and metaphysical 
assumptions, there were other historical factors that contributed to a gradual yet steady change in domestic 
values, which were so fundamental in the middle class moral code. Gender stereotypes, which were so 
ardently supported in Sarah Stickney Ellis’ The Women of England: Their Social Duties and Domestic Habits 
(1839) as the cornerstones of domestic ideology, were systematically attacked in the 1840s and 1850s,

initiating what has been called the Woman Question. There were many women who found the idea of 
marriage as the only alternative in their lives suffocating, and thus fought for equal rights with men. Caroline 
Norton, Harriet Martinaeu, Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, and Bessie Rayner Parkes, among others, played a 
decisive role in the 1850s parliamentary debates which led to the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 which 
made divorce legal and provided for the protection of divorced, separated, and deserted wives.  
 What also led to the 1857 Matrimonial Causes Act was quite unexpectedly the British defeat at the 
Crimean War that took place from 1853 to 1856. The failure, incompetence, and mismanagement on the part 
of the authorities outraged the disillusioned public which demanded radical reforms. In sharp contrast, 
nevertheless, to the inadequacy and ineffectuality of the male high-class authorities, a modern heroine 
emerged out of this war. Florence Nightingale rose to prominence as the organizer and manager of a very 
efficient team of nurses that tended the wounded soldiers during the war. “The Lady with the Lamp,” as 
Nightingale came to be known, was not only the founder of modern nursing but actually foregrounded the role 
of women as crucial and helpful agents of the public sphere as well. She thus played a crucial role in the 
professionalization of nursing for women, setting up the first secular school for nurses which unlocked the 
gates of women’s domestic seclusion.

An image that depicts the fate that awaits women who leave the domestic warmth and seek adventure in the public 
sphere. 

  
Despite its double standards for men and women, as well as its many shortcomings, the 1857 Act gave 

relative autonomy to women, paving the way towards the improvement of their status. As a consequence of 
the Act, many constitutional efforts were made towards women’s equality. During the debates about the 
Second Reform Bill, J. S. Mill, a Member of the Parliament then, suggested that women should also vote, and 
in 1869 he published his controversial essay The Subjection of Women, in which he argues in favour of 
equality between men and women. However, another series of Acts brought to the forefront the inequality 
between men and women and infuriated certain liberal thinkers. These were the Contagious Diseases Acts, 
successively passed in 1864, 1866, and 1869, which permitted the authorities to perform genital inspection on 
women who were suspected of venereal disease and who would subsequently be detained in hospitals. Men 
were, of course, neither inspected nor penalized on grounds that this would harm the morale of the army and 
put national security at risk. This comprised not only a violation of the rights of women, since it subjected 
them to public humiliation, but, most importantly, failed to eradicate or at least deal with the problem. In 
1886, these Acts were repealed, and a number of other Acts set the stepping stones for women’s 
independence. The 1870 Education Act, for instance, helped women get new employment opportunities as 

74

teachers, and in 1882 The Married Woman’s Act gave women rights to the property acquired before and after 
marriage. All these actions led to the first feminist wave.  

The shift in the sociopolitical climate is reflected in a number of Victorian heroines who question the 
restrictive roles society forces on them by developing an oppositional discourse against dominant morals. One 
of the harshest critiques of the domestic ideal came with William Thackeray’s novel Vanity Fair (1847-48). 
Becky Sharp, the daughter of a penniless artist and the heroine of the novel, climbs up the social and 
economic ladder by cynically exploiting anybody who stands in her way. Through the heroine’s embodiment 
of social mobility and the economic principles of the time, the novel illustrates that domestic values are, like 
everything else, a product of the “cash nexus,” and, as such, part of the social facade and the play of 
appearances upon which most Victorian morals rested. This facade is also exposed in two novels written in 
the same year; Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre (1847) which, in its claustrophobic domestic imagery, dramatizes 
the struggle between self-expression and self-repression and exposes the limited rights and sparse educational 
and career prospects that women had; and Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights (1847), a story of the conflicts 
between the uncontrollable forces of passion and middle class respectability. The latter implicitly cauterizes 
the cult of domesticity through its formal structure. The framed narratives create an atmosphere of uncertainty 
and subjectivism that casts an uncanny light upon the domestic sphere. Home is no longer presented as a 
warm and safe refuge, but rather as the locus of thwarted desire, unfulfilled passions, and secret traumas. This 
is why in both novels the authors borrow from the Gothic tradition in order to illustrate the darker side of the 
domestic sphere. A few years later, in The Mill on the Floss (1860), George Eliot’s heroine, Maggie Tulliver, 
is considered to be a mistake of nature by her family and local community due to her untamable nature and 
passion for education and love. Maggie’s tragic, but wished for, death by drowning at the end of the book can 
also be read as a proto-feminist victory, as it signals her refusal to fit into the reproductive model of her time. 

4.3 Women’s Representation in Poetry by Men 

Women knew that in order to improve their position they would have to change the way they were culturally 
perceived and socially represented. Thus, they revolted against the stereotypical and patronizing way in which 
female figures were represented by male poets. As poetry written at the time was a very popular and 
influential genre, male authors had established a tradition of idealizing women as melancholic domestic 
figures who functioned as poetic inspiration, as discussed above. Apart from Tennyson’s numerous female 
figures, another striking example is D. G. Rossetti’s “The Blessed Damozel” (1850). In this poem, a male 
lover gazes up the heaven as his departed beloved lady looks at him longing for their reunion. Through 
language that brings together religious and sexual imagery, the damozel is presented as virginal yet 
maintaining certain implicit sexual overtones. She is turned, in other words, into an idealized reverie in the 
mind of a man and appears as he would have liked her to be: a woman eternally longing for him and 
ultimately becoming his inspiration.

Drawing on Tennyson’s poem, this sketch illustrates the stereotype of a melancholic domestic woman who waits for a 
man to come and make her life meaningful. 

 
A second dominant characteristic in the way male poets presented female characters involved their 

ventriloquizing and objectification. In Tennyson’s “Marianna” (1830), for example, the voice of the female 
character is conditioned and mediated by the male speaker who will not let her speak for herself, while in 
“The Lady of Shallot” (1832), we never hear the Lady’s voice throughout the entire poem. In Victorian 
poetry, women are often treated as the objects of male imagination and not as independent subjects. This 
becomes particularly clear in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” (1842), where the Duke/speaker controls 
what the readers know about his young wife. He also commodifies her literally by turning her into a painting 
in his possession. In the poem, the last image of the statue of Neptune taming sea horses is indicative of the 
fate of his poor wife whose female nature had to be disciplined by male authority because it was considered 
threatening. In a similar vein, in D. G. Rossetti’s “Jenny” (1860), the male speaker takes pity on a prostitute 
he has hired, Jenny, and lets her fall asleep on his knee. Jenny becomes an object of contemplation for the 
speaker who reads her as if she were a book. She inspires speculation and pity since she is presented as 
incapable of realizing the full implications of her social plight.

4.4 Women’s Representation in Literature by Women 

Drawing on the changes in the social and political climate, women writers started portraying female figures 
that turned against patriarchal tradition and deviated from the domestic model. In the 1850s, “spinsters” 
became dominant figures in novels, reflecting the fact that a third of the women at the time were not married. 
This was not only a shift towards realistic writing, since it recorded a historical fact, but also an attempt to 
bring women out of the male shadow and present them under their own light. “Spinster” figures in Brontë’s 
Shirley (1849) and Villette (1853), or in Gaskell’s Cranford (1853) and Ruth (1853), signaled women’s 
distancing from the domestic ideal, as well as their gradual incorporation into the public sphere. Indicative of 
this trend that wanted to undermine the tradition of representing women as inactive and domestic is Gaskell’s 
central heroine in North and South (1855), Margaret Hale. Through this dynamic female character, Gaskell 
eradicates the division between the two separate spheres, the domestic and the public, by bringing together 
social and family themes. Leaving the traditional South behind, Margaret and her family move to the 
industrial North, where she is introduced not only to the plights of the industrial workers, but also to a young 
self-made industrialist, John Thorton. In a seminal moment in the book, Margaret chooses to mediate between 
John Thorton and the angry mob of workers during a strike. This act signals the emergence of women in the 
public sphere, and indirectly introduces the issue of women’s rights into the social reform agenda of the 
industrial novel.  
 The tradition of female idealization and objectification, along with the cult of separate spheres, are 
also harshly criticized in Aurora Leigh (1856), a best-selling poem of the time, composed by Elizabeth Barrett 
Browning, Robert Browning’s wife. Written in blank verse, this autobiographical poem traces the 
development of a female poet through her struggle to harmonize her aspirations with love, something which, 
as the third person narrator ironically admits, is definitely not the case with male authors. Barrett Browning 
questions the Victorian stereotype of separate spheres as Aurora can become domestic only when she has 
conquered the public. Browning also attacks the constant idealization of women in male poetry. This is why 
Aurora refuses to get married and chooses to pursue the difficult career of a poetess. But the poem gives voice 
to female victims as well. In many instances in the poem, prostitution is attacked and sympathy is drawn for 
the poor fallen women who are sexually exploited. These radical ideas are enhanced through the very 
innovative form of this work, as Aurora Leigh is a poetic novel that crosses the boundaries of genres. The 
poem ends with the vision of a New Jerusalem, a new world where women would have equal rights and 
chances with men.

Image 2.10 Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s illustration of “The Goblin Market.”  

The issue of female solidarity that Christina Rossetti wanted to highlight is evident in this illustration. 
 
 The second most influential mid-Victorian female poet after Barrett Browning was Christina Rossetti. 
As the youngest child in a family of poets, artists and philosophers, she was closely associated with the Pre-
Raphaelite Brotherhood, in which her brother was a founding member. As a woman, she had little place in a 
“brotherhood,” and this was probably why she was 
involved throughout her life with the establishment of 
sisterhoods. Rossetti was actively involved with feminist 
groups and even volunteered to offer her services to a 
refuge for fallen women. It comes as no surprise then that 
much of Rossetti’s work was a critique of marriage and 
traditional Victorian domestic values.  

In one of her most well-known poems, “Goblin 
Market” (1859), Rossetti appropriates the Pre-Raphaelite 
portraits of women with accentuated femininity in order 
to deal with the theme of female sexuality. Through the 
fairy tale narrative of two sisters, Laura and Lizzie, the 
poem illustrates the dangers that await a woman once she 
leaves the haven of her domestic sphere. The fact that 
Rossetti frames her story within a fairy tale narrative 
helps her sublimate the connotations of female sexuality 
and the issue of the fallen woman. Rather than judge or 
condemn Laura, who is seduced by the goblins, the 
narrative promotes understanding and social acceptance, 
as she is eventually saved by her sister. Rossetti’s version 
of the fallen woman is in sharp contrast with D. G. 
Rossetti’s portrayal of a fallen woman in “Jenny” (written 
in the 1850s but published in the 1870s), where female sexuality necessarily leads to marginalization. In 
“Goblin Market,” the problems of female commodification and objectification are overcome through female 
solidarity. 

 

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood:  
 

In 1848 D. G. Rossetti, a poet and painter, 
along with his brother William Michael 

Rossetti, and William Holman Hunt, John 
Everett Milliais, Thomas Woolner, James 
Collinson, and Frederick George Stephens 
formed the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. 

They wanted to go against the neoclassical 
style of the Royal Academy of Painting 
which was dominant at the time. They 
favored fidelity to the natural world by 

being inspired by medieval and early 
Renaissance artists. By the 1860s, their 

style was dominant and their work 
influenced many avant-garde movements 
and trends that became prominent in the 

1890s.

4.5 The New Woman and the Decline of Domesticity 

Sydney Grundy, from The New Woman  
 

From Act 1 
 
Sylvester: Yes, I am Mrs. Sylvester’s husband. I belong to my wife, but my wife doesn’t belong to 
me. She is the property of the public. Directly I saw her photograph in a shop-window I realized the 
situation. People tell me I’ve a wife to be proud of; but they’re wrong. Mrs. Sylvester is not my wife; 
I am her husband. 
Colonel: [taking up a book] This is what comes of educating women. We have created a 
Frankenstein. “Man, the Betrayer—A Study of the Sexes—by Enid Bethune.” 
Sylvester: Oh, I know her. She comes to our house. 
Colonel: And has a man betrayed her? 
Sylvester: Never. Not likely to. 
Colonel: That’s what’s the matter, perhaps? 
Sylvester: Her theory is, that boys ought to be girls, and young men should be maids.  
[Colonel throws down the book.] That’s how she’d equalize the sexes. 
Colonel: Pshaw! [Takes up another book.] “Ye Foolish Virgins!—A Remonstrance—by Victoria 
Vivash.” 
Sylvester: Another soul! She’s also for equality. Her theory is, that girls should be boys, and maids 
should be young men. Goes in for latchkeys and that sort of thing. 
Colonel: [throws down the book] Bah! [Takes up a third.] “Naked and Unashamed—A Few Plain 
Facts and Figures—by Mary Bevan, M.D.” Who on earth’s she? 
Sylvester: One of the plain figures. She comes to our house, too.

down.] Why can’t a woman be content to be a woman? What does she want to make a beastly man 
of herself for? 
Sylvester: But my wife isn’t a woman. 
Colonel: None of them are, my boy. A woman, who is a woman, doesn’t want to be anything else. 
These people are a sex of their own, Sylvester. They have invented a new gender. . . . 
[Enter Enid and Victoria, in hot argument. …] 
Enid: I can’t agree with you! Say what you will, I can’t agree with you! 
Victoria: That doesn’t alter the fact. A woman has just as much right to a latchkey as a man. 
Enid: Rudeness is not argument! 
Victoria: Why make distinctions? 
Enid: I make no distinctions. I admit that a woman has just as much right to come home with the 
milk as a man but I say, a man has no right to come home with the milk; and I say more—no woman 
who respects herself has any desire to come home with the milk! 
Victoria: Bother the milk! It isn’t a question of milk. It’s a question of making artificial distinctions 
between the sexes. 
Enid: I say that there ought to be no distinction! Why should a man be allowed to commit sins— 
Victoria: And woman not be given an opportunity? 
Enid: Then do you want to commit sins? 
Victoria: I want to be allowed to do as men do. 
Enid: Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself; there! 
Victoria: I only say, I ought to be allowed. 
Enid: And I say that a man, reeking with infamy, ought not to he allowed to marry a pure girl— 
Victoria: Certainly not! She ought to reek with infamy as well. 
Enid: Victoria! [Knock without.] 
Victoria: What is the difference between man and woman? 
Enid: There is no difference! . . . 
Lady Wargrave: Excuse my ignorance, but I have been away from England for so many years. Can 
this be the New Woman I have read about? 
Colonel: Everything’s New nowadays! We have a New Art— 
Enid: A New Journalism— 
Victoria: A New Political Economy— 
Doctor: A New Morality— 
Colonel: A New Sex! 
Lady Wargrave: [smiling] Ah! 
Doctor: Do you object to modernity? 
Lady Wargrave: I’ve only one objection to new things; they are so old. 
Victoria: Not the New Woman! 
Lady Wargrave: No; she is generally middle-aged. . . .

Image 2.12 An image of a New Woman suggesting a drastic change of gender roles. 
 
The term “New Woman” was coined in 1894 to denote a self-reliant, outspoken, educated, and 
unconventional type of woman that was very popular in certain narratives of the time. These narratives 
signaled a new rising collective consciousness of femininity. Drawing on the earlier tradition of the Fallen 
Woman and the campaigns of the proto-feminists, feminist voices gained new momentum in the 1880s and 
1890s, as a result of certain historical factors. First, the fact that in the 1870s women were allowed to attend 
university education boosted their hopes and aspirations of reaching, like men, higher social ranks and opened 
new vistas for women, who started re-envisioning a life based on equality. This is precisely what the extract 
from Sydney Grundy’s play ridicules when claiming that education has created female monsters. Last but 
certainly not least, the staging of Ibsen’s plays created heated debates about the social position of women and 
popularized the roles of unconventional women who rebelled against inequality and injustice.  
 As we have already seen, the figure of the independent and rebellious woman was the focus of many 
earlier novels or poems. What changed in the last decades of the century was the perspective from which such 
independence was regarded. In other words, these unconventional heroines were no longer considered to be 
failures, or social peculiarities that the narratives were anxious to regulate through marriage, but they were 
rather presented in a positive light. This implied that the institution of marriage was not socially idealized any 
longer, as we can infer from the increasing presence of unmarried women in late Victorian narratives and the 
distrust in the marriage plot, the epitome of mid-century domesticity. In Anthony Trollope’s novels, for 
example, and especially in The Way We Live Now (1875), we witness the dissolution of traditional norms 
through the rise of a new kind of self-interest that corrodes domestic ideals. Echoing Carlyle’s critique, 
Trollope presents a world in which all traditional values are replaced by money, and marriage is only 
considered as a means of financial success. George Meredith’s novel The Egoist (1879) records the burdens of 
domestic tyranny, while the cornerstone of Victorian domesticity, family life, is harshly questioned in Samuel 
Butler’s novel The Way of All Flesh (1903). All fundamentals of Victorian morality are presented here as 
empty institutions that have nothing to offer anymore.

into the public sphere is experienced by men as a form of intrusion. 
 
The dissolution of the marriage plot cast an emancipatory light on women characters. Thus, in Grant 

Allen’s The Woman Who Did (1895), the protagonist refuses to marry her beloved and prefers to live with him 
outside wedlock. Henry James’ The Portrait of a Lady (1881), The Bostonians (1886), What Maisie Knew 
(1897), The Awkward Age (1899), The Wings of the Dove (1902), and The Golden Bowl (1904) all record 
emancipated independent women with vibrant sexualities and illustrate the disruptive force of desire within 
family life. Thomas Hardy has also created multiple paradigmatic New Women. In Tess of the D’Urbervilles 
(1891), Hardy shocked his contemporaries with the sexual boldness of the heroine, whereas in Jude the 
Obscure (1895) he offers a critique of matrimony through Sue Bridehead’s highly unconventional views on 
marriage. Both Tess and Sue encapsulate the spirit of the New Woman in a very concise way.  

As female sexuality was no longer connected exclusively with the institution of marriage, it acquired 
a new essence, and women were able to enjoy new forms of freedom. One of the basic arguments of first-
wave feminists was precisely that female sexuality can be freely expressed only if it is dissociated from 
marriage and motherhood. The claim for sexual liberation was the reason why the New Woman cause was 
affiliated with the aestheticist and decadent sexual agenda; they both promoted new sexual types and 
emancipation from middle class Victorian stereotypes. In their sexual cause, the New Woman novels brought 
together and harmonized two earlier trends of the Victorian tradition: the social problem novel that focused on 
public discourse and the novel of domestic realism that concentrated on private discourse.

5. Religion and Evolutionary Theory 

5.1 Crisis of Faith 

 
Matthew Arnold, “Dover Beach”  
 
The Sea of Faith 
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth’s shore  
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled. 
But now I only hear 
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, 
Retreating to the breath 
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear 
And naked shingles of the world. (21-8) 

 
Religion occupied a central position in Victorian life whether it was ardently supported or passionately 
rejected. Traces of religious language or thought can be observed in all dominant cultural, historical, and 
political discourses, and nearly all Victorian thinkers and writers dealt with it one way or another. In the 
1830s, long before the publication of Darwin’s work, Victorians experienced a prominent crisis of faith 
motivated by a thick web of factors that persistently attacked religious faith. These factors basically involved 
the distrust that people felt over the disputes and antagonisms between English churches or sects, as well as 
the radical secularization of people’s worldview that the rise of science, technology and consumption brought 
about. This intense Victorian preoccupation with the loss of a unifying, coherent and meaningful narrative is 
characteristically presented in Matthew Arnold’s poem “Dover Beach” (1867). There used to be once, Arnold 
argues, a “sea of Faith” that provided soothing comfort to people and a sense of meaning to their lives, but 
now the world is bare of its metaphysical magic and beauty. The force behind all this was none other than the 
then dominant scientific narrative of evolutionary theory which presented the world as comprising only 
matter: “vast edges drear / And naked shingles.”

5.2 Evolutionary Theory and Charles Darwin

84 
 



Victorian and Anti-Victorian Voices 
 

Charles Darwin, from On the Origin of the Species  
 
In this extract, Darwin defines the term “struggle for existence” which became one of the most 
influential and misappropriated aspects of his theory.  
 
Hence, also, we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new country amongst new 
competitors, though the climate may be exactly the same as in its former home, yet the conditions of 
its life will generally be changed in an essential manner. If we wished to increase its average 
numbers in its new home, we should have to modify it in a different way to what we should have 
done in its native country; for we should have to give it some advantage over a different set of 
competitors or enemies. 

It is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage over another. Probably 
in no single instance should we know what to do, so as to succeed. It will convince us of our 
ignorance on the mutual relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it seems to be 
difficult to acquire. All that we can do, is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving 
to increase at a geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its life, during some season of the year, 
during each generation or at intervals, has to struggle for life, and to suffer great destruction. When 
we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not 
incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and 
the happy survive and multiply. 

 
Although Darwin’s groundbreaking book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or 
Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life was published in 1859, the concept of evolution had 
been widely discussed decades before that. As early as 1833, Charles Lyell’s The Principles of Geology 
recorded geological findings that radically questioned biblical assumptions and the idea that the world was 
divine creation. Evolution, though, came to be tightly associated with Darwin, as he provided a very coherent 
and convincing theory which could account for the emergence of certain species in a way that could be easily 
understood by nearly everybody. This easy-to-follow narrative made also possible the popularization of the 
argumentation against religion.  

The controversy about the descent of man is well captured in numerous literary texts from all genres. 
Robert Browning’s poem “Caliban Upon Setebos; or Natural Theology in the Island” (1864), for instance, 
questions and undermines the idea that man was made in god’s image. The poem is a monologue that draws 
on Shakespeare’s play The Tempest (1610-11), in which Prospero, a noble magician, is shipwrecked on an 
island inhabited by a bestial native, Caliban. While this animal-like creature is unable to grasp the magnitude 
of higher metaphysical forces, it is able to perceive instinctively how evolution works. At some point in his 
monologue, Caliban alludes to Darwin’s idea of natural selection, the mechanism that propels evolution and 
allows certain species to survive. In Caliban’s words, only those species which adapt by “running,” “diving,” 
or “fleeing” will endure : 

 
There is the sport: discover or die! 
All need not die, for of the things o’ the isle 
Some flee afar, some dive, some run up trees; 
Those at His mercy,—why, they please Him most 
When […] when […] well, never try the same way twice!  

(218-222) 
 

 Through the figure of Caliban, Browning does not only reflect the implications of Darwin’s 
argumentation, but also addresses contemporary questions about man’s origin, the existence of god, and man’s 
ability to understand all this. Throughout the poem, Browning presents many different interpretations and 
versions, yet no conclusion is eventually reached. Such open-endedness reflects the anxiety Victorians 

85 
 



Yannis Kanarakis 

experienced due to the unresolved dilemma between science and religion, or evolutionary theory and 
theology, they had to cope with..  
  The remarkable aspect of Darwinian theory was that it could be appropriated by both progressive and 
conservative discourses for different purposes. It could either stand for opposition to religious orthodoxy, as in 
the case of Browning, or represent a set of ideas that promoted continuity rather than a radical break from the 
status quo. It could, moreover, be viewed in terms of optimism or pessimism. Thus, concepts like “natural 
selection” or “the struggle for survival” were optimistically considered by many Victorian thinkers to be in 
tune with the laissez-faire economy that actively contributed to the nation’s progress. The association between 
biology and economy or sociology was initiated basically by Herbert Spencer (1820-1903), a prominent 
Victorian philosopher, biologist and sociologist, who coined the term “survival of the fittest” to describe the 
competitiveness and ruthless struggle for success that characterize modern societies. Spencer’s idea that 
societies, very much like organisms, evolve from simpler to more complex forms deeply affected the 
discipline of anthropology. All these ideas, however, which comprised the backbone of this attempt to make 
ethics out of science, called social Darwinism, were definitely a misinterpretation of Darwinian theory, which 
clearly argued that there was no governing principle, end or telos in the evolutionary process.  

It was precisely on these grounds that evolutionary theory was interpreted by other thinkers at the 
time as scientific proof of moving backwards rather than forwards. The randomness with which the universe 
operates, they argued, as well as the fact that humans are insignificant creatures in a cruel universe that does 
not care about them are not signs of progress. Thomas Hardy’s (1840-1928) work illustrates this pessimism, 
and represents the darker and crueler side of evolutionary theory. When Charles Knight slips, falls, and is 
suspended from a cliff in one of Hardy’s earlier works, A Pair of Blue Eyes (1873), he sees a fossil and 
speculates minutes before his end on the fact that evolutionary time makes no sense in the face of death. In 
Jude the Obscure (1894), Hardy’s last novel, the universe is indifferent to the dreams and aspirations of its 
characters, and constantly crushes them in a cruel way. Only the characters who are able to adjust to a 
changing world, in which there is no divine providence, manage to survive in the end.  

 

Friedrich Nietzsche, from The Twilight of the Idols  
 
In this extract, the German philosopher discusses the inability of the English to get rid of Christian 
morality. 
 
They are rid of the Christian God and now believe all the more firmly that they must cling to 
Christian morality. This is an English consistency; we do not wish to hold it against little moralistic 
females à la Eliot. In England one must rehabilitate oneself after every little emancipation from 
theology by showing in a veritably awe-inspiring manner what a moral fanatic one is. That is the 
penance they pay there. 

We others hold otherwise. When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to 
Christian morality out from under one’s feet. This morality is by no means self-evident: this point 
has to be exhibited again and again, despite the English flatheads. Christianity is a system, a whole 
view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one 
breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one’s head.  

 
It is important to note here that either as a form of providence or as lack of it, evolutionary theory was 

directly or indirectly associated with a new form of morality. This was because it did not only undermine faith 
but also replaced it as an organizing narrative that could provide order amidst the chaos and anxiety that the 
loss of faith had left behind. As a consequence, some writers strove to harmonize science and religion on 
moral grounds: Charles Kingsley, a clergyman, combined theology and evolutionary theory in his writings; 
Philip Henry Gosse brought together zoology with Evangelicalism; finally, Gerald Manley Hopkins’ poetry 
regarded science as a manifestation of God’s design. Although the Victorians appeared eager to do away with 
religion as an outdated system that could no longer account for the new spirit of the times, in many cases, they 
actually reshaped Christian ideas in a more secular form. This was precisely the argument that Nietzsche 

86 
 



Victorian and Anti-Victorian Voices 
 

presented against George Eliot and the Britons in general for failing to fully get rid of the burden of Christian 
morality. Nietzsche is probably right, as all basic Victorian values, such as self-sacrifice, honesty, humility, 
respectability, earnestness, and virginity, were nothing but secularized, traditional religious values. Even the 
device of the omniscient narrator, a defining characteristic of most major Victorian novels, can be seen as a 
secularized version of divine providence; in a god-like fashion, omniscient narrators distributed justice by 
punishing crime and rewarding virtue.

Thomas Hardy, from A Pair of Blue Eyes  
 
This is a characteristic example of Hardy’s pessimistic view of evolutionary theory. 
 
Haggard cliffs, of every ugly altitude, are as common as sea-fowl along the line of coast between 
Exmoor and Land's End; but this outflanked and encompassed specimen was the ugliest of them all. 
Their summits are not safe places for scientific experiment on the principles of air-currents, as 
Knight had now found, to his dismay. 

He still clutched the face of the escarpment—not with the frenzied hold of despair, but with a 
dogged determination to make the most of his every jot of endurance, and so give the longest 
possible scope to Elfride’s intentions, whatever they might be. 

He reclined hand in hand with the world in its infancy. Not a blade, not an insect, which spoke of 
the present, was between him and the past. The inveterate antagonism of these black precipices to all 
strugglers for life is in no way more forcibly suggested than by the paucity of tufts of grass, lichens, 
or confervae on their outermost ledges. 

Knight pondered on the meaning of Elfride’s hasty disappearance, but could not avoid an 
instinctive conclusion that there existed but a doubtful hope for him. As far as he could judge, his 
sole chance of deliverance lay in the possibility of a rope or pole being brought; and this possibility 
was remote indeed. The soil upon these high downs was left so untended that they were unenclosed 
for miles, except by a casual bank or dry wall, and were rarely visited but for the purpose of 
collecting or counting the flock which found a scanty means of subsistence thereon. 

At first, when death appeared improbable, because it had never visited him before, Knight could 
think of no future, nor of anything connected with his past. He could only look sternly at Nature’s 
treacherous attempt to put an end to him, and strive to thwart her. 

From the fact that the cliff formed the inner face of the segment of a huge cylinder, having the 
sky for a top and the sea for a bottom, which enclosed the cove to the extent of more than a 
semicircle, he could see the vertical face curving round on each side of him. He looked far down the 
facade, and realized more thoroughly how it threatened him. Grimness was in every feature, and to 
its very bowels the inimical shape was desolation. 

By one of those familiar conjunctions of things wherewith the inanimate world baits the mind of 
man when he pauses in moments of suspense, opposite Knight’s eyes was an imbedded fossil, 
standing forth in low relief from the rock. It was a creature with eyes. The eyes, dead and turned to 
stone, were even now regarding him. It was one of the early crustaceans called Trilobites. Separated 
by millions of years in their lives, Knight and this underling seemed to have met in their death. It was 
the single instance within reach of his vision of anything that had ever been alive and had had a body 
to save, as he himself had now. 

The creature represented but a low type of animal existence, for never in their vernal years had 
the plains indicated by those numberless slaty layers been traversed by an intelligence worthy of the 
name. Zoophytes, mollusca, shell-fish, were the highest developments of those ancient dates. The 
immense lapses of time each formation represented had known nothing of the dignity of man. They 
were grand times, but they were mean times too, and mean were their relics. He was to be with the 
small in his death. 

Knight was a geologist; and such is the supremacy of habit over occasion, as a pioneer of the 
thoughts of men, that at this dreadful juncture his mind found time to take in, by a momentary sweep, 
the varied scenes that had had their day between this creature's epoch and his own. There is no place 
like a cleft landscape for bringing home such imaginings as these. 

Time closed up like a fan before him. He saw himself at one extremity of the years, face to face 
with the beginning and all the intermediate centuries simultaneously. Fierce men, clothed in the hides 
of beasts, and carrying, for defence and attack, huge clubs and pointed spears, rose from the rock, 
like the phantoms before the doomed Macbeth. They lived in hollows, woods, and mud huts—
perhaps in caves of the neighbouring rocks. Behind them stood an earlier band. No man was there. 
Huge elephantine forms, the mastodon, the hippopotamus, the tapir, antelopes of monstrous size, the 
megatherium, and the myledon—all, for the moment, in juxtaposition. Further back, and overlapped

by these, were perched huge-billed birds and swinish creatures as large as horses. Still more shadowy 
were the sinister crocodilian outlines—alligators and other uncouth shapes, culminating in the 
colossal lizard, the iguanodon. Folded behind were dragon forms and clouds of flying reptiles: still 
underneath were fishy beings of lower development; and so on, till the lifetime scenes of the fossil 
confronting him were a present and modern condition of things. These images passed before 
Knight’s inner eye in less than half a minute, and he was again considering the actual present. Was 
he to die? The mental picture of Elfride in the world, without himself to cherish her, smote his heart 
like a whip. He had hoped for deliverance, but what could a girl do? He dared not move an inch. Was 
Death really stretching out his hand? The previous sensation, that it was improbable he would die, 
was fainter now. 

However, Knight still clung to the cliff. 
To those musing weather-beaten West-country folk who pass the greater part of their days and 

nights out of doors, Nature seems to have moods in other than a poetical sense: predilections for 
certain deeds at certain times, without any apparent law to govern or season to account for them. She 
is read as a person with a curious temper; as one who does not scatter kindnesses and cruelties 
alternately, impartially, and in order, but heartless severities or overwhelming generosities in lawless 
caprice. Man's case is always that of the prodigal's favourite or the miser’s pensioner. In her 
unfriendly moments there seems a feline fun in her tricks, begotten by a foretaste of her pleasure in 
swallowing the victim. 

Such a way of thinking had been absurd to Knight, but he began to adopt it now. He was first 
spitted on to a rock. New tortures followed. The rain increased, and persecuted him with an 
exceptional persistency which he was moved to believe owed its cause to the fact that he was in such 
a wretched state already. An entirely new order of things could be observed in this introduction of 
rain upon the scene. It rained upwards instead of down. The strong ascending air carried the rain-
drops with it in its race up the escarpment, coming to him with such velocity that they stuck into his 
flesh like cold needles. Each drop was virtually a shaft, and it pierced him to his skin. The water-
shafts seemed to lift him on their points: no downward rain ever had such a torturing effect. In a brief 
space he was drenched, except in two places. These were on the top of his shoulders and on the 
crown of his hat.

Another example of how the concept of evolution was misread and ridiculed. 

5.3 Science and Art: Realism 

Darwinism greatly contributed to the popularity of scientific discourse as reflected in the rise of realism. 
Realism drew on the scientific model because it was a means of understanding the world in a way that had 
nothing to do with the outdated illusions of the artistic, the metaphysical, or the Romantic worldview. The 
new era was after all about truth and “facts,” as mentioned above. So realism actually involved the 
representation of life as the average reader saw and experienced it.  

It was basically through George Eliot that realism became very popular in Britain. Eliot’s brand of 
realism was different from the French realism of Balzac or Flaubert, which became prominent in the 1850s. 

90 
 



Victorian and Anti-Victorian Voices 
 

Although Eliot was in tune with the French realists in focusing on the everyday, unlike them, she subjected 
her realism to a moral end in order to encourage her readers’ sympathy. Realism, thus, signaled the 
representation and explanation of the world through middle-class values in order to give meaning and validity 
to these values. In other words, as it became evident in Eliot’s case, it was an optimistic moral code imposed 
upon the world not based on religion but rather on positivism and science.  

By the 1870s, however, realism became less optimistic when it was transformed into Naturalism. 
Naturalism was a brand of realism that claimed to be closer in detail to reality than realism itself, and it was 
affected by Darwinian theory. Naturalism portrayed human beings as a form of organic matter solely 
determined by heredity and the environment, and presented the idea of free will as a cosmic joke. Such 
determinism is evident in Thomas Hardy’s Jude the Obscure (1895), where it is impossible for the main 
characters to escape the limitations that the environment has set on them, or the faults and misery of their 
parents and families. 

5.4 Degeneration: From Progression to Regression

This photograph illustrates the transition from culture to savagery. 
 

Towards the end of the nineteenth century, there was a growing awareness that Victoria’s reign, 
which had brought so much glory to the nation, was approaching its decline. As a result, the fin-de-siècle 

91 
 



Yannis Kanarakis 

became inevitably associated with decay and even degeneration. Many of the rising social phenomena and 
artistic trends of the period were interpreted by Max Nordau, the Zionist physician and social critic, as signs 
of a degenerating world. In his book, Degeneration, published in 1892 and translated into English in 1895, 
Nordau holds that modernity is a sort of pathological disease, the symptoms of which are expressed in 
symbolist or pre-Modernist literature. Nordau based his theory on Darwin’s Theory of Evolution and the idea 
that species are not static or fixed. If species can evolve and progress, then they might as well regress into 
weaker and less developed forms. This pessimistic biological model was employed by Nordau to account for 
social ills as well, such as poverty, alcoholism, sexual perversion, and criminality. 

Nordau’s theory also established a correlation between individual and racial or cultural progress. 
Children were identified with primitive tribes, since they were both perceived as immature, innocent and 
naive, whereas adulthood was correlated with stages of advanced civilization. This association highlighted the 
proximity of young ages and certain tribes to the animal realm, and consequently undermined the domestic 
security and safety that Victorians cherished. If animals gradually turned into more developed living forms, 
then under certain circumstances humans could revert to an animal state, too. This meant that a developed 
culture could just as easily regress into more primitive stages, as an adult could regress into childlike behavior. 
Nordau’s theory thus highlighted the fact that the indispensable (and inescapable sometimes) other side of 
progress and evolution was regression. The anxiety of degenerating into earlier brutal forms of life is very 
clearly dramatized in Stevenson’s story Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, in which Dr. Jekyll, the intellectual, 
prestigious, and cultivated doctor, reverts to Mr. Hyde, his primitive and animalistic “other” governed by 
primitive instincts and desires. The same fear of devolution is addressed in a number of fin-de-siècle texts, 
such as Oscar Wilde’s Dorian Gray, H. Rider Haggard’s She, H. G. Wells’ The Time Machine, and Joseph 
Conrad’s Heart of Darkness.  

In general, most literature of the fin-de-siècle alludes to dark irrational forces lurking beneath the 
surface and threatening to destabilize the established order of things. These disruptive forces may take several 
forms: in Hardy’s work, they are manifested as uncontrollable sexual urges, in Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. 
Hyde, as repressed psychological elements, in James’ The Turn of the Screw (1898) as the nightmares of child 
libido. In ways reminiscent of the Gothic, such narratives addressed the darker side of progress and 
highlighted the importance of the past. Although progress was a move away from tradition, such Gothic 
narratives brought back the past in the form of what Freud a few years later would call “the return of the 
repressed.”

6. The Rise and Fall of the British Empire 

6.1 The Rise of the British Empire  

 
Image 2.18 Map of the English Empire (1897). 

 
As already stated, the industrial boom, supported by an overwhelming shipping force, led to an unprecedented 
expansion of Britain’s markets during the mid-nineteenth century. Meanwhile, with the acceleration of British 
colonization, English language and culture spread throughout the world. In 1849, the dominion over India, 
“the chief jewel in the imperial crown,” was completed, while the discovery of gold in Australia in 1851 led to 
large-scale immigration. Throughout the last decades of the century, Britain annexed vast areas in Africa, the 
Far East, and the Pacific. The Britons had been familiar with risky expeditions through the Romantic 
fascination with adventurous travels and the “exotic” other. However, the concept of a powerful and leading 
worldwide empire became prominent only with “the Indian Mutiny” of 1857-58, when the revolt of certain 
Indian troops in Northern India led to the killings of a number of Britons and Britain’s subsequent fierce 
reaction. This marked a radical shift in the discourse that accompanied Britain’s imperial expedition, which no 
longer proclaimed to be solely a peaceful process of carrying the torch of civilization, but also, if needed, a 
forceful struggle that would suppress “savagery.”  

The right to forceful rule was further supported by a proliferation of scientific discourses, some of 
which were based on racial and imperialist versions of “the survival of the fittest” doctrine which provided the 
necessary ideological justification for racial or national supremacy. This was the time when the Britons 
realized the magnitude of their empire and its raw force, and felt more than ever before an urgent need to 
implement new conceptions of Englishness, i.e., what it meant to be English in the modern world. The more 
Britain expanded as an empire and was exposed to a wide array of foreign “others,” the more this concept of 

93 
 



Yannis Kanarakis 

Englishness was solidified and strengthened against the primitiveness of the peoples it came in contact with. 
We should not forget that Britain at the time was the most technologically, scientifically and industrially 
advanced nation in the world. Moreover, the constant political reforms and the extension of franchise made 
Britons feel that their country was a very modern democracy. The overall climate of success and expansion is 
reflected in the literature of the time, where the empire is no longer a peripheral presence, but occupies a 
central position. 
 The imperial prestige of Britain, moreover, helped heal the wounds that the Crimean war had left 
behind. This failure had seriously damaged and questioned not only English heroism but manhood as well. 
The new hero that emerged out of the war, after all, was a woman. Britain’s imperial expansion reinforced the 
call for a new hero and a modern English man, giving birth to what Charles Kingsley would call “muscular 
Christianity.” This novel form of manhood was infused with the traditional middle class values of 
respectability, honor, and earnestness which were then additionally seasoned with the cosmopolitan air of 
international success and victory. The new stereotype that brought together imperialism, Christianity, and 
Englishness is manifest in Rudyard Kipling’s Puck of Pook’s Hill (1906) and Rewards and Fairies (1910). 
Both books consist of short stories and a poem that precedes each story. Through fantasy narratives, these 
stories present the history of England and its imperial adventures. Puck of Pook’s Hill culminates in a patriotic 
song that is meant to teach children the superiority of England as well as its values and morals, while Rewards 
and Fairies ends with a Christian poem, which is meant to remind readers of the fact that domestic ideology is 
a crucial part of Englishness.  
   

 

 

 

6.2 Imperial Decline  

In 1877, Queen Victoria was declared Empress of India, which signaled the peak of British imperialist 
confidence, since Queen Victoria ruled one quarter of the world’s population. The Britons soon became aware 
of the nation’s unprecedented power and prestige. During the last two decades of the century, the empire 
became a central preoccupation that affected nearly every facet of people’s lives. As imperialism was gaining 
momentum, nevertheless, it also began to be radically questioned by those who doubted that the empire would 
be able to sustain its supremacy and impose its order upon the natives, or those who were concerned about the 
fate and state of indigenous people under the British reign. This concern is reflected in Wilkie Collins’s novel 
The Moonstone which projects some sort of national guilt and a feeling that there is a price that has to be paid 
for conquered “exotic” places. Moreover, as the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee approached in the summer of 1897, 
there was widespread concern about the frailty of the monarch and, consequently, the empire. These concerns 
were amplified by a growing competition between Britain and the emerging new powers, such as the USA, 
Germany, or Prussia. George Eliot’s Daniel Deronda (1876), for instance, reflects this international 
competitive climate, as it is set in various cities throughout the world and acknowledges implicitly different 
centers of power. The imperial uneasiness and decline of confidence was officially recorded in the Berlin 
Conference in 1884 which divided Africa among European powers. The time had come when imperialist 
prestige was beginning to collapse.  
 The literature of the time both addressed and attempted to resolve all these anxieties. The resurgence, 
for example, of romance and its growing popularity in the 1880s could be attributed to such imperialist fears. 
Apart from being a reaction to realist crudeness, romance grew in popularity in the 1880s because it was a 
narrative that was implicitly aligned with the imperialist agenda. It involved exotic, faraway settings that were 
presented through narratives of conquest in tune with the nation’s imperial expeditions around the world, 
increasing thus the nation’s self-assurance. As such, romance counterbalanced the discourse of decline by 
offering an implicit imperialist cause through an escapist discourse. Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island 
(1883) heralded the resurgence of the romance, and so did Rider Haggard’s King Solomon’s Mines (1885),

She (1887), and Allan Quatermain (1887). In a similar manner, Kipling’s stories provided a vision of a 
coherent, stable, and invincible national subject which would inspire new imperialist narratives. Thus, the 
upheavals and concerns that were so widespread during this time are totally absent from his work. Kipling 
invented a new form of military aristocracy able to counter foreign threats and disperse fears of imperial 
decline.  
 On the other hand, there were a number of works that clearly and directly recorded the darker side of 
imperialist rule through what we call imperial Gothic. Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897) explicitly embodies the 
anxiety about foreign threat. Interestingly, the figure of Count Dracula successfully brings together many 
potential threats: the foreigner, the Catholic, the aristocrat, the sexual pervert, the dandy, and the fear of 
syphilis coming from abroad. All these threats embody the dangers of turning one’s back against middle class 
domestic morality; they actually highlight the conservative need to turn towards these values as a means of 
maintaining order. Joseph Conrad’s work, conversely, chronicles the decline of empires as liberating through 
an early Modernist idiom. Conrad’s narrative expresses disillusionment with the imperialist discourse, partly 
through his steering away from realist devices. Imperialism is exposed as a form of ruthless exploitation, 
associated with the savagery and “the horror” that lies deep down in the white man’s psyche. This is why 
Kurtz, in Conrad’s novella Heart of Darkness (1899), regresses into a primitive and chaotic state after having 
faced the darkness that lies within him. This dark aspect of the truth is revealed to him only when he acts as an 
agent of imperialist barbarism.  

7. Culture and Aesthetics 

The concept of culture became one of the central topics of debate in the mid and late Victorian period, as it 
was widely believed that through culture the wild impetus of the middle and working classes would be 
mitigated. Gradually, however, culture became a refuge to ideas or attitudes that were threatened by the 
supposedly vulgarizing tastes of the bourgeoisie. In this sense, the notion of culture maintained a double role 
as either a means of cultivating the middle and working classes (for Matthew Arnold), or as an arrogant means 
of marking a distance from them (for Oscar Wilde, the Aesthetes, and the Decadents).  

7.1 Culture and Anarchy 

The fascination that the middle and working classes had with commercial forms of entertainment was 
followed by a growing concern with the degrading impact of mass culture on them. As a result, throughout the 
1860s and 1870s, the Victorian sages were preoccupied with the education of the masses. The matter gained 
new urgency due to a historical event on the 22nd of June 1866, when a number of marchers were denied 
access to Hyde Park and a thousand yards of park railings were destroyed by outraged rioters. This incident 
urged Thomas Carlyle to write an essay entitled “Shooting Niagara: And After?” (1867), in which he 
expresses his concern about the “swarmocracy,” as he called it, of the angry reformers. In turn, Matthew 
Arnold responded to this debate in a series of essays entitled Culture and Anarchy (1867-68). Modern 
individual liberty, Arnold claims here, lacks any form of restraint or sense of public duty or discipline and 
only culture can prevent the reign of anarchy. Arnold upholds the idea of culture against the materialism and 
vulgarity of the philistines (those hostile against culture) and believes that acculturation will be achieved 
through “general perfection,” the combination, that is, of intellectual playfulness and moral discipline, beauty 
and practicality (or, what he symbolically calls, Hellenism and Hebraism). He defines culture as a force that 
will make individuals aware of the fact that their progress is a common, not an individual, pursuit. For Arnold, 
Britain suffered from the fact that its three different classes, what he calles the barbarians (the land-owning 
aristocracy), the philistines (the middle classes), and the populace (the poor and the unemployed) could not 
transcend their conflicting self-interests and embrace mutuality. Arnold’s notion of culture, in other words,

was nothing else but the Victorian preoccupation with the relation between the individual and the common 
good, as discussed above.  
 

 
Image 2.19 Cartoon of Matthew Arnold from Punch.  
 
 Only a year before the passing of the second Reform Bill (although set during the upheaval of the first 
Reform Bill), George Eliot’s novel Felix Holt, The Radical instructs the working poor through the concept of 
culture. Reminiscent of Arnold, culture here is upheld as a means through which anarchy can be prevented 
and democracy safeguarded. The protagonist, Felix, realizes that his individuality makes sense only when 
considered as an extension of the common good, and that class differences will be surmounted via a type of 
social experience that is shared by everybody. 
 The debates about the role of culture and education gradually affected literary tastes and styles in the 
following decades. By 1870, Tennyson stopped being considered the nation’s favorite poet and was replaced 
by Robert Browning. Tennyson, accessible and widely read, was considered a mainstream poet writing for the 
masses, while Browning, more obscure and hard to follow, was closely affiliated with a more elitist form of 
culture which the privileged classes promoted. Consequently, the notion of culture encompassed a new sense 
of elitism, shaping the literature that followed, and steadily paving the way for Modernist elitism.  
  It is also important to note that what actually lurked beneath the discourse of culture was anxiety 
about the extension of franchise that the second Reform Bill would bring about by allowing the vote to all 
working men who had a permanent residence. Such extension, the cultured and affluent classes feared, would 
endanger their own rights and leave them at the mercy of the uneducated and unrefined majority. Through 
education and culture, that is, these classes wanted to make sure that long held traditions, institutions, and 
values would not be overthrown by the sweeping force of the rising middle classes. 
 

Matthew Arnold (1822-1888):  
 

Matthew Arnold, the son of Dr. 
Thomas Arnold, a famous educator 

(1795-1842), was a prominent 
Victorian poet and critic. His poetry 
expresses the anxiety generated by 

religious doubt (as evident in “Dover 
Beach,” “Morality” and “The Future”), 
whereas his criticism introduced the 

middle-classes to the benefits of 
culture. Both his criticism and his 

poetry were oriented towards social 
utility and strived to have relevance 

to society.

7.2 Aestheticism: The Cult of Beauty 

 
Image 2.20 Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Rosa Triplex (1874).  

What is striking here is both the sensuality of these figures and their androgynous characteristics. 
 

Walter Pater, from The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry  
 
The presence that thus so strangely rose beside the waters I expressive of what in the ways of a 
thousand years man had come to desire. Hers is the head upon which all “the ends of the world are 
come,” and the eyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh, the 
deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it for 
a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how 
would they be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its maladies has passed? All the 
thoughts and experience of the world have etched and moulded there in that which they have of 
power to refine and make expressive the outward form, the animalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, 
the reverie of the middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the return of the 
Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias. She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like the 
vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in 
deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastrern 
merchants; and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary; 
and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with

which it has moulded the changing lineaments and tinged the eyelids and the hands. The fancy of a 
perpetual life, sweeping together ten thousand experiences, is an old one; and modern thought has 
conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon by, and summing up in itself, all modes of thought 
and life. Certainly Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy, the symbol of the 
modern idea.  

 
One of the most influential artistic and cultural movements of the time, that had its roots in the early 

and mid-Victorian period, was Aestheticism, also known as the 
“Art for Art’s Sake” movement. Aestheticism was a movement 
that celebrated the supremacy of beauty and art over morality 
and science. For the aesthetes, as its followers were called, 
morality was considered to be a bourgeois convention and a 
distraction from the exploration of formal perfection and 
beauty. Aestheticism was initially a French literary 
phenomenon, introduced in Britain by Algernon Swinburne in 
1866 through his Poems and Ballads. In these poems, 
Swinburne presents explicit sexual imagery in a sensual idiom 
and refuses to be limited by any moral constraints. What was 
deeply shocking for his contemporaries was the fact that 
Swinburne’s collection of poetry celebrated a kind of pleasure 
that had nothing to do with domestic Victorian ideals and 
norms.  

Swinburne’s ideas were followed by Walter Pater. In 
The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry (1873), which was 
probably the most influential book in the late Victorian and 
early Modernist period, Pater argues that art should not have a 
practical relevance to life or to morality but rather be devoted 
to the search for beauty and perfection. He argues, moreover, 
that the transitory character of life can be transcended or 
preserved through perfect moments of sensory intensity that 
one can find solely in art. This is his point exactly in the 
extract about Mona Lisa quoted above. Pater is not so much 
interested in describing the famous painting or giving his 
reader historical details about it, but rather in recording the 
fleeting impressions, thoughts, and feelings that the painting 
generates in him.  

In their attempt to escape censorship, the aesthetes 
favored form over content, that is, beauty over moral teaching. 
In this sense, they promoted the superiority of form. By paying 
more attention to technical detail or aesthetic finesse, the 
aesthetes sometimes created very sophisticated, complex, and 
hard to follow narratives, in which meaning became 
ambiguous or simply elusive. Such elusiveness of meaning 
was contrasted with the dominant ideology of the time which 
laid emphasis on practicality, materialism, and utilitarianism. 
This is precisely why Oscar Wilde argues in the Preface to The 
Picture of Dorian Gray, a highly concise manifesto of 
aestheticism, that all art is useless. For Wilde and the aesthetes, 
art had to be cherished for its beauty only, not its usefulness. 
The aestheticist opposition to the dominant ideology of the 
time is also evident in its escapism, its tendency, i.e., to deny 
any practical or moral relevance, or any engagement with life 
or history.  

Formalism: 
 

A critical and artistic movement that 
appeared in the early 20th century 

and focused basically on the form and 
style of a work of art rather than its 
historical or cultural context. This 

approach to literature tends to 
disregard biographical information 
related to the creator of a text and 

concentrate on its inherent features, 
such as grammar, syntax, or literary 
devices. There were two main schools 
of formalist literary criticism: Russian 
formalism and Anglo-American New 

Criticism. 

Symbolism:  
 

Symbolism involves the use of symbols 
in order for ideas to be expressed; an 

object i.e., is meant to stand for a 
totally different idea. In literature, 
symbolism is achieved through the 

use of figures of speech such as 
metaphor, simile, or allegory. As a 
movement, the term refers to 19th 

century French writers such as 
Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud, 

Paul Verlaine, and Stephane 
Mallarme. These writers developed a 
technique of implicit suggestiveness 

through the use of symbols that 
influenced writers in Britain or the 
United States, such as W. B. Yeats, 
Ezra Pound, Dylan Thomas, and 

Wallace Stevens.

By distancing themselves from the realm of action or practicality and by indulging into eccentricity 
and pleasure, the aesthetes were accused of being effeminate. Most aesthetic literature and art was, after all, 
one of the first homosexual subcultures, as it communicated in a coded way a same-sex form of love. 
Consider, for instance, the paintings of Simeon Solomon, one of the most emblematic aesthete painters, and 
the homosexual subtext they contain. In this light, the aesthetes’ argument in favor of artistic autonomy could 
also be an encrypted cry for sexual freedom. It is not accidental that the most characteristic figures of 
aestheticist art and philosophy are either androgynous or celebrate an asexual kind of beauty that alludes to 
same-sex love, and is distanced from bourgeois sexual models and norms. In combining both male and female 
characteristics, such human forms are the embodiments of the idea of a united or unified soul. These figures 
need not rely on the other sex for their pleasure or propagation and invite the viewer to put aside moral 
judgments in order to appreciate their beauty.

things. 
The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. 
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. 
This is a fault. 
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For 
these there is hope. 
They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty. 
There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That 
is all. 
The nineteenth century dislike of Realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass. The 
nineteenth century dislike of Romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass. 
The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in 
the perfect use of an imperfect medium. 
No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved. 
No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable 
mannerism of style. 
Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art. 
Vice and virtue are to the artist materials of his art. 
From the point of view of Form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician. From the point of 
view of Feeling the actor’s craft is the type. 
All art is at once surface and symbol. 
Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. 
Those who read the symbol do so also at their peril. 
It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. 
Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. 
When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. 
We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for 
making a useless thing is that one admires it inordinately. 
All art is quite useless. 

7.3 Decadence  

 
Image 2.22 The first Volume of The Yellow Book (1894). 

 
The movement of Decadence that followed aestheticism is so tightly linked with it that it is sometimes hard to 
distinguish between them. The Decadents, just like the aesthetes, believed in the cult of beauty, artistic 
autonomy, and the unconventional. Yet, the Decadents took the aestheticist fascination with the ephemeral 

100 
 



Victorian and Anti-Victorian Voices 
 

and turned it into an obsession with the beauty of the fleeting moment. They sought to experience the 
aestheticist moments of intensity through drugs, sexual extremities, or abuse. This was why Decadent art was 
marked by a celebration of hallucination, immorality, pain, or mental and physical illness. Moreover, the 
Decadents’ pursuit of peculiar sensual stimuli led them to a fascination with artificiality as a means of having 
new sensations and pleasures that lay beyond moral or natural conventions. In its turn, this fueled a fascination 
with shock as a means of transcending and disrupting daily routine and, of course, scandalizing the 
bourgeoisie. In literature, this was achieved by undermining the reader’s expectations for coherence, linearity, 
and meaningfulness through a complex and over-refined style. Consider, for example, Swinburne’s 
“Nephelidia” (1880), a poem with almost no content or meaning, resting exclusively on acoustics and a highly 
sophisticated and complex form:  

 
From the depth of the dreamy decline of the dawn through 

a notable nimbus of nebulous noonshine, 
Pallid and pink as the palm of the flag-flower that flickers 

with fear of the flies as they float, 
Are they looks of our lovers that lustrously lean from a 

marvel of mystic miraculous moonshine, 
These that we feel in the blood of our blushes that  

thicken and threaten with throbs through the throat?  
      (ll. 1-8) 

What is interesting to note here is that at a first glance the poem appears to be coherent. Taking a 
closer look at it, nevertheless, one discovers that this sense of coherence does not rely on meaning at all, since 
the poem is very ambiguous, but rather on its musicality, which involves the use of alliteration, complex meter 
and rhyming patterns. By showing an alternative organization of words based on their sounds, Swinburne 
manages to challenge his readers’ conception of how meaning is produced.  

Decadent art was also shocking due to its risqué (or improper) character which emphasized sexual 
dissidence as a means of attacking and undermining middle class normality. This is clearly evident through 
The Yellow Book, an iconic Decadent periodical that published the most provocative and controversial work of 
the time. The editor of The Yellow Book was Aubrey Beardsley, a very contentious illustrator. His 
groundbreaking illustrations foreshadowed formalism and art-nouveau, laying the foundations for modern 
graphics and design as well. Apart from the risqué topics and figures that they depicted, Beardsley’s 
illustrations could often stand as autonomous works, refusing to be subordinated to the narratives they were 
meant to accompany and exemplify. Furthermore, his work was influenced by Japanese art in its denial to 
depict a three-dimensional reality, revealing thus his fascination with surface and the rejection of depth. 
Moreover, by illustrating mythical figures or characters from 
traditional and established literature within a sexual context, 
Beardsley mingled “high” and “low” art in a very postmodern, 
we might argue, way. Consider, for example, Beardsley’s 
illustration of Wilde’s play Salome (1891, 1894); the heroine 
here is presented as a threatening castrating femme fatale 
engaged in an erotic play with John’s head. As Biblical 
allusions are reduced to a minimum, what predominates is the 
decoration of a depthless surface, while the relation between 
the illustration and the original Biblical story is eliminated.  

The Aesthetic and Decadent movements were abruptly 
terminated with Wilde’s conviction for sodomy at the close of 
the century. Wilde was sued by his boyfriend’s father for 
corrupting his son, Lord Alfred Douglas. Being at the peak of 
his success, Wilde fool-heartedly counter-sued the father for 
libel, but lost the case and was sentenced to two years of hard 
labor. This verdict was at the same time an implicit conviction 
of sexual anarchy and dissidence, and an attempt to legalize 
normality or, what were considered to be, healthier and more 
productive sexual models.  

 

Art-Nouveau:  
 

Art-Nouveau was an architectural 
and decorative movement of the 

second half of the nineteenth century. 
Art-Nouveau designers were inspired 
by geometric and organic forms in an 

attempt to foreground the 
craftsmanship involved in their works, 
something which industrial products 

lacked. Art-Nouveau artists wanted to 
dissolve the distinction between high 
art (painting, sculpture) and low art 

(furniture, architecture, everyday 
objects).

Victorian and Anti-Victorian Voices 
 

8. Neo-Victorianism: The Victorians in the 20th and 21st Century 

Since the 1960s there has been a vogue for recreating the 
nineteenth century in contemporary fiction. This trend, 
which became especially popular in the last 25 years, has 
been termed by critics as “Neo-Victorianism” or 
“Victoriana.” When it comes to the definition of this trend, 
it is important to note that the Neo-Victorian novel is not 
just a version of historical fiction, for it is not the historical 
setting that makes a novel Neo-Victorian. Critics claim that 
Neo-Victorian fiction rather involves a close engagement 
with the nineteenth century through which the relationship 
between contemporary and Victorian culture is closely 
investigated and comparisons between the two ages are 
invited. 

What is it, though, that has instigated the 
emergence of Neo-Victorian literature but not Neo-
Romantic, Neo-Renaissance, or Neo-Augustan revivals? 
Researchers point out that there has been a fascination with 
the Victorian period because of its proximity to our age. 
Although the nineteenth century appears to be distant, 
dissimilar, and unfamiliar to us in some respects, it is close, 
similar, and familiar in others. Much like the Victorians, 
today we are preoccupied with such topics as gender and 
sexuality, imperialism, civil rights and minorities, the 
invasion of technology, and the role of tradition in a 
radically shifting world. In the words of the French 
historian and critic Michel Foucault, we are still Victorian, 
as he claims in the first chapter of The History of Sexuality 
(3). Our proximity to the Victorians invites comparisons 
which can illuminate both the past and the present, 
affording us a view of the future as well. By revisiting the 
not so distant past, authors address issues from radically 
different points of view or in entirely new settings, creating 
thus an amalgamation of Victorian and contemporary 
aesthetics. In doing so, they are given the chance to cast 
new light on the past and use it as a filter through which the 
present can also be reviewed.  

The fact that the trend is believed to have 
originated in the 1960s is not accidental but rather 
indicative of its association with the movement of 
postmodernism. In its attempt to recreate the past, the Neo-
Victorian novel has actually adopted all major 
characteristics of postmodern literature: the incorporation 
of a variety of discourses, pastiche, intertextuality, parody, 
or sophisticated conceptions of history. For example, 
Margaret Forster’s Neo-Victorian novel Lady’s Maid 
(1990) is a rewriting of the affair between two famous 
Victorian poets, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett 
Browning, as perceived through the eyes of Barrett’s maid. 
Forster employs the postmodern device of pastiche, a form 
of imitation that mixes different styles, in order to 
reimagine not only a famous love affair but also the 
nineteenth-century convention of narrating a story from a 

Pastiche:  
 

One of the most striking characteristics of 
postmodernism is that it incorporates a 

wide variety of styles, discourses, 
narratives, or schools not for the sake of 

parodying them but rather for the sake of 
celebrating diversity.  

[For more on postmodern literature, see 
Chapter 4.] 

Intertextuality:  
 

The term, which was given prominence 
by the Bulgarian philosopher and 

psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva, denotes the 
complex and thick web of 

interrelationships that exist between 
texts either in a direct manner through 

allusion, citation, and pastiche or through 
parody. As such, it signifies the 

interdependence and interconnectedness 
that exists between literary works, and 
foregrounds the idea that there are no 
original texts, but only copies of copies. 

 

Metafiction:  
 

The term refers to stories which self-
reflexively draw attention to themselves 
or to their elements. Sometimes this gets 
the form of direct commentary on the act 
of reading or writing. This way the reader 
is encouraged to think about the process 
of storytelling as an artificial process and 
not as reality itself. Even though this is a 
Modernist or Postmodernist practice, it 
can be traced back to Cervantes’ Don 
Quixote (1605, 1615) and Laurence 

Sterne’s Tristram Shandy (1756).  
 

103 
 



Yannis Kanarakis 

maid’s perspective. By blending fiction with historical facts in a very postmodern way, Forster comes up with 
a complex narrative that raises the question of class and its relation to truth. In a similar fashion, in Arthur and 
George (2006), the awarded contemporary writer Julian Barnes reconstructs an incident in Conan Doyle’s 
personal life, in which the famous author tries to help a half-Indian solicitor be acquitted of a crime he did not 
commit. Employing the figure of the creator of one of the most emblematic pursuers of truth, Sherlock 
Holmes, Barnes explores the relation between race and truth through a pastiche of narratives that undermines 
the very act of knowing, representing, or even of establishing a coherent identity.  

What is also important to consider here is the issue of intertextuality which is quite revealing of the 
politics of Neo-Victorian fiction. The Victorian era is not merely employed as a historical setting, but rather as 
an intertext meant to be rewritten. Let us consider Will Self’s 2002 novel Dorian, An Imitation. The book 
transposes Wilde’s climate of decadence and degeneration of the fin de siècle into the early 1980s artistic club 
London scene, where sex and drugs reign. Dorian’s corruption is here suggested through the fact that the 
protagonist suffers from AIDS and infects his victims rather than kill them or corrupt them as Dorian does in 
Wilde’s text. Instead of Dorian’s picture, we end up with Cathode Narcissus, a video installation in which 
Dorian’s naked body can be seen aging and bearing all AIDS symptoms, while Dorian enjoys a virus-free 
image and life. Wilde’s implicit allusions to gay culture are here given an explicit twist and acquire a central 
role. Self’s rewriting forces the reader to reconsider in retrospect Wilde’s story and develop a new 
understanding not only of the original text but also of the pre-AIDS age as well. The modernization of Wilde’s 
text is achieved through the intricate interconnections that are established between the end of the nineteenth 
century and the 1980s and that involve postmodern readings and understandings of history.  
 In a similar fashion, J. G. Farell seizes the opportunity in The Siege of Krishnapur (1973) to exploit 
the issue of the empire afresh and reconstruct the Indian Mutiny of 1857. Based on this historical event, which 
actually solidified British imperialism, Farell creates an anti-colonial narrative that is harshly critical of the 
British rule in India. The story focuses on the way a group of Englishmen react when they are trapped by the 
siege. Their entrapment, set against the backdrop of the Great Exhibition, ironically brings to the surface the 
delusions, pride, and arrogance upon which British superiority was based and which the Exhibition fueled. 
The assumed progress of British culture and science, for instance, is challenged when British doctors are 
unable to deal with an epidemic of cholera that breaks out among the besieged. The besieged Englishmen are 
gradually forced to question their position in India, while their role as agents of culture and civilization is 
ridiculed. Victorian imperialism in Farell’s Neo-Victorian novel is presented through a contemporary lens. At 
the same time, history is exposed as a study in cultural and historical relativism rather than a discipline of 
truth. This process of reinterpretation and revision, which necessitates the rediscovery of the past, is in essence 
postmodern.  
 Apart from the novel, Neo-Victorianism involves films, TV series, comics, fashion, and music. In 
other words, it is an extensive and inclusive cultural phenomenon that has its own sub-categories and sub-
divisions. A very important such subdivision is steampunk, a fusion of science fiction, cyberpunk, fantasy, 
and historical fiction by way of Neo-Victorianism, in which the future is anachronistically set during the 
Victorian times when technological inventions are powered only by steam. Most prominent novels in this 
tradition include The Anubis Gates by Tim Powers (1983), Homunculus by James Blaylock (1986), Internal 
Devices by K. W. Jeter (1987), The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling (1990), 
Extraordinary Engines by Nick Gevers (2008), and comic book series such as The League of Extraordinary 
Gentlemen, or animation films such as Steamboy (2004).  
 

Significant texts in the Neo-Victorian tradition include, among others, Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean 
Rhys (1966), The French Lieutenant’s Woman by John Fowles (1969), The Seven Percent Solution 
by Nicholas Meyer (1974), Possession: A Romance by A. S. Byat (1990), Mary Reilly by Valerie 
Martin (1990), The Gate of Angels by Penelope Fitzerald (1990), Poor Things by Gray Alasdair 
(1992), Chatterton by Ackroyd Peter (1996), Jack Maggs by Peter Carey (1997), Tipping the Velvet 
by Sarah Waters (1998), Affinity by Sarah Waters (1999) The Dark Clue by Wilson James (2001), 
The Music of the Spheres by Elizabeth Redfern (2001), Dorian an Imitation by Will Self (2002), The 
Crimson Petal and the White by Michel Faber (2002), Fingersmith (2002) by Sarah Waters, The

Re-cap: 
 
 The Victorian era was a period when Britain 

underwent radical changes and became an 
industrial and colonial superpower. 

 During the Victorian period, religion and the 
Church were overthrown by science, a fact 
which led to an unprecedented secularization 
and rationalization of everyday life.  

 During the Victorian Era, the working class 
and women gradually gained more rights.  

 This was also the time when older cultural 
forms were replaced by newer ones and the 
novel became the dominant genre.

9. Conclusion 

The Victorian era was one of the longest periods in British history during which many radical changes took 
place in economy, science, technology, politics, culture and religion. The way the Victorians responded to 
these changes was not uniform but rather diverse, making variety and conflict two of the most defining 
characteristics of the period. This is precisely why it is hard to schematically sum up the period into a few 
words. What we can, nevertheless, note is that such diversity and conflict was definitely indicative of the 
profound democratization and modernization that the English society underwent at the time, giving birth to 
some novels, poems and prose writing that still manage to fascinate the reading public.

Chapter Three 

Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century  
Katerina Kitsi-Mitakou 

1. Introduction 

The aim of this chapter is to explore the complexity, slipperiness, and elasticity of the term “realism.” 
Although realist fiction is undoubtedly committed to a historical particularity, as a form of mimesis, realism 
can never be identical with that which it represents, since its tools, i.e., language/words, can never function as 
flawless, objective mirrors. The serious artistic treatment of ordinary people and their experience, linear plots, 
omniscient narrators, round characters are, of course, elements associated with a realistic mode of 
representation. Yet, the British nineteenth-century realist project is not explicit, and British realist writers 
seem to exploit narrative techniques in ways that acknowledge the impossibility of a hundred percent 
objective representation and even question the nature of reality.

2. Cinderella’s Foot in the Real World 

Charles Perrault, Cinderella, from Andrew Lang, The Blue Fairy Book  
  
 
“I wish I could. I wish I could.” She was not able to speak the rest, being interrupted by her tears 
and sobbing. 

This godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said to her, “You wish that you could go to the 
ball; is it not so?” 

“Yes,” cried Cinderella, with a great sigh. 
“Well,” said her godmother, “be but a good girl, and I will contrive that you shall go.” 

Then she took her into her chamber, and said to her, “Run into the garden, and bring me a 
pumpkin.” 

Cinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to her 
godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could help her go to the ball. Her 
godmother scooped out all the inside of it, leaving nothing but the rind. Having done this, she 
struck the pumpkin with her wand, and it was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with 
gold. 
………………………………………………………………………………………………………. 

[…] a few days later, the king’s son had it proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would 
marry her whose foot this slipper would just fit. They began to try it on the princesses, then the 
duchesses and all the court, but in vain; it was brought to the two sisters, who did all they possibly 
could to force their foot into the slipper, but they did not succeed. 

Cinderella, who saw all this, and knew that it was her slipper, said to them, laughing, “Let 
me see if it will not fit me.” 

Her sisters burst out laughing, and began to banter with her. The gentleman who was sent 
to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and, finding her very handsome, said that it was 
only just that she should try as well, and that he had orders to let everyone try. 

He had Cinderella sit down, and, putting the slipper to her foot, he found that it went on 
very easily, fitting her as if it had been made of wax. Her two sisters were greatly astonished, but 
then even more so, when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket the other slipper, and put it on her 
other foot. Then in came her godmother and touched her wand to Cinderella's clothes, making them 
richer and more magnificent than any of those she had worn before. 

 
Is there any piece of writing that can seriously and convincingly claim to have nothing to do with 

realism? Fairy tales, one could readily reply, as they rely on the element of the supernatural and feature 
fantasy characters like elves, giants or fairies. In the first excerpt above, for example, Cinderella’s fairy 
godmother in Charles Perrault’s familiar story provides the magic solution to her problem by transforming a 
pumpkin into a golden carriage and enabling Cinderella to attend the royal ball and meet the prince. So far in 
the story, we know for sure that the narrative defies logic and depends on the reader’s trust in fantasy. Yet the 
“poor-girl-gets-handsome-prince” happy ending of the story is a chilling reminder of a harsh reality associated 
with women’s subservient role in Chinese history, as the second excerpt quoted above suggests. If 
Cinderella’s tiny foot (the only foot in the kingdom which fits into the glass slipper) is the only indicator that 
allows the prince to recognize her as the most appropriate bride, this unique characteristic originates in the 
Chinese practice of foot-binding which first began in the days of the Song dynasty (960-1279) and was not 
banned until as late as 1911. Small feet, or “lotus feet,” were both a symbol of beauty in China, and also a sign 
of submission: as their feet were bandaged tightly for years during childhood to prevent growth, women 
suffered severe pains and were forced to stay inside the house. Read in this light, Perrault’s fairy tale actually 
encloses another very realistic tale with a tragic ending: the violent custom of literally maiming women’s feet 
and training them to become obedient wives.

Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

 
 
 

In the spectrum of fiction, genres like biography, the historical novel or realism would normally be 
diametrically opposed with diaries, science fiction, or fairy tales; it is important to understand, however, that 
all kinds of writing incorporate realistic elements and are, therefore, to a larger or smaller extent, affiliated 
with realism.  

3. Le Réalisme: Realism in Art 

Although, as mentioned above, every piece of writing bears some connection to an external reality, realism as 
a movement in art and literature was established in the middle of the nineteenth century. The first appearance 
of the term is associated with the French novelist Champfleury (1820-1889) who endorsed it during the 1840s. 
It was, however, the French painter Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who actually established the term, when in 

1855 he opened a solo exhibition which he called Le 
Réalisme. This display of his works, which took place 
outside the grounds of the official Universal Exhibition 
in Paris, was triggered by the fact that the committee of 
the Universal Exhibition had rejected two of his major 
paintings. The paintings which Courbet exhibited were a 
real shock to the critics and the bourgeois audience of 
the time; they initiated a revolution in art, as they broke 
away from his contemporary anti-modern nostalgia and 
the academic high art which, from 1400 to 1800, had 
been dictated by Renaissance theories of idealized 
painting. Courbet steered away from mythological 
themes and rejected the gravity, rigidity, and austere 
heroism of Neoclassicism or the extreme emotionalism 
of Romantic painting.  

The tendency to return to classical antiquity and 
view the present through the prism of the past, for 
example, is clearly evident in Jacques-Louis David’s 
1799 painting The Intervention of the Sabine Women. 

The horror of the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror, a period during which David had been 
imprisoned as a supporter of Robespierre, is reflected in a scene from Roman history. The theme of the 
painting, which refers to the Sabine women intervening in order to put an end to the battle between the 
Romans and Sabines, suggests that the painting can be read as an indirect appeal to the people for putting an 
end to the atrocities of the revolution. In his 1830 romantic painting, Liberty Leading the People, Eugène 
Delacroix also mythologizes the present by personifying liberty as a bare-breasted woman leading the people 
forward over the bodies of the fallen. Although the central figure in the painting shows characteristics of an 
actual fighter and woman of the people with a bayonetted musket in her left hand, she is also an allegorical 
goddess figure bearing the emblem of a new era in her right hand, the tricolor flag of France.

Neoclassicism:  
 

A movement in art and architecture that 
coincided with the eighteenth-century Age of 
Enlightenment, and continued into the early 

nineteenth century. 
 

Romanticism:  
 

An artistic, literary, and intellectual 
movement that originated in Europe toward 
the end of the eighteenth century and in most 

areas reached its peak in the period from 
1800 to 1850.

It is exactly this idealism represented in the art of classical mythology that Courbet is opposed to 

when, in his realist manifesto, he denies “the possibility of historic art applied to the past.” “Each epoch,” he 
writes in an open letter to his students in 1861, “must have its artists who express it and reproduce it for the 
future. An age which has not been capable of expressing itself through its own artists has no right to be 
represented by subsequent artists. This would be a falsification of history.” As an artist of the historical 
present, Courbet focuses on everyday and ordinary subjects and presents them in an uncomplicated and direct

manner, as “painting is an essentially concrete art and can only consist of the representation of real and 
existing things.” He wanted to be the pupil of no one but nature and present real people not idealized type 
characters. Along with Courbet, a number of nineteenth-century artists, like Jean-Francois Millet, Ivan 
Shishkin, Franz von Lenbach, or Thomas Eakins, pushed the limits of what was at the time thought of as 
acceptable in art, as they focused on the base and rough aspect of life, the working class, rural or urban life, 
busy streets and crowd scenes, and presented human nature and the nude body with unprecedented bluntness.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Consider, for instance, Millet’s 1857 painting The Gleaners: its central characters are three female 

figures caught in a rather awkward pose as they bend to gather grain left by reapers. What is striking here is 
not only the emphasis on the beggar women in the foreground, or the very pedantic and raw theme of the 
painting that would have brought the nineteenth-century viewers face to face with a harsh reality they 
probably wanted to overlook, but also the fact that the painter ascribes a certain elegance and grace to their 
back breaking labour. And, in the process of doing so, it is almost as if Millet’s painting is contributing to the 
democratization of art. Courbet himself admitted being influenced by the anarchist philosopher Pierre-Joseph 
Proudhon who introduced materialist social thought to France in the 1840s, at the same time Karl Marx’s 
early writing appeared. “Let us humble ourselves,” Proudhon urges artists in Du principe de l'art et de sa 
destination sociale (“The Principle of Art and its Social Destination”) “beneath the weight of our 
unworthiness. It is really not such a trifling thing to be able to show us as we are. In all these respects, I dare 
say that, aside from the finish of the execution, […] the painting of Courbet is more serious and higher in its 
aim than almost anything that the Dutch school has left” (204). “Art,” he concludes, “has the objective of 
leading us to the knowledge of ourselves by the revelation of all our thoughts, even the most secret ones, of all 
our tendencies, of our virtues, of our vices, of our ridiculousness, and in this way it contributes to the 
development of our dignity, to the perfecting of our being. It was not given to us to feed ourselves with myths, 
to intoxicate ourselves with illusions, to deceive ourselves and lead ourselves into evil with mirages as the 
classicists and romantics would have it, as well as all the sectarians of a vain ideal, but rather, to deliver 
ourselves from these harmful illusions by denouncing them […]” (225).

Katerina Kitsi-Mitakou 
 

In his picture Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet (1854), Courbet likewise brings art down to the level of the 
everyday and the ordinary. As the title of the painting suggests, it simply involves the painter walking across 
country in his working clothes with his painter’s tools on his back and greeting his friend and patron. There is 
nothing elevated here in the poses of the figures, the tramp-like artist they salute, or the flat and uninspired 
rustic background. And, although, of course, a twenty-first-century viewer would detect nothing shocking in 
this painting, in 1854, Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet was a blow against middle-class pretentiousness and 
artistic decorum. Courbet’s aim was to dissociate art from the superficial propriety and the clichés of 
academicians and assert the value of persistent artistic sincerity and boldness. In his pursuit of truth, he 
realized that the eye of the painter needed to refocus and invest on the raw, base, and crude working material 
that life provided, for life, after all, originates in nothing else but expendable flesh. Courbet makes this explicit 
in his uniquely provocative painting, which even today still has the power to stun or alarm, The Origin of the 
World (1866). This painting, with its extraordinary angle and the close-up view of the female genitals and part 
of the upper torso of a woman lying with legs spread, is sharply contrasted with the refined and idealised 
nudes of the past. With exceptional audacity it proclaims that it is exactly in the hitherto vulgar and offensive 
aspects of human life and the world where truth can be traced.

Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

4. Realism and the Novel 

4.1 Feudalism and Medieval Romances 

Realism is inextricably bound with the genre of the novel which reached a peak in England in the eighteenth 
century and which is, in turn, largely associated with the rise of the middle class. As artistic and literary 
production depends on the political, social, economic and cultural context of a certain time and place in 

history, it is crucial to examine the conditions that 
contributed to the spread and dominance of this new 
mode or representation.  

The novel was born with the birth of capitalism 
in Europe and the new bourgeois class that led to an 
increase of literacy and the growth of a large, widely 
distributed reading public. This new form of realistic 
writing came as a reaction to the medieval romance and 
its courtly descendants of the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries, and reflected the changes in the new social 
system that succeeded medieval feudalism. In feudal 
societies, power rested on a warrior nobility (the lords) 
who owned the land (fiefs) and granted permission to the 
vast majority of the population (vassals or serfs) to 
cultivate the land. In exchange for the land and the 
protection that the lord offered, the serfs were obliged to 
serve him in a slavish way. The life of serfs revolved 
around paying fees and taxes to the lords in the form of 
manual labour in the fields (ploughing, harvesting, 
digging, etc.). Serfs had no personal rights and little 
control over their lives, and it was impossible for them to 
change their status in a society characterized by social 
rigidity and intellectual conservatism. Moreover, the 

main concern of the ruling class in feudalism was to maintain the ownership and preserve the status quo; 
consequently, the few elect that could read wanted a literary genre that would promote and exalt the values 
and principles of the aristocracy.  

Chivalric romances, the dominant genre of medieval aristocracy, project an idealized world and offer 
a substitute living through an escape into a pseudo-world of courtliness, adventure and gallant knights with 
superhuman powers who complete quests successfully and win the favour of the lady they are in love with. By 
presenting an improved, almost perfect picture of the world, romances carried the readers away from the 
problems of their everyday reality and urged them to ignore their hardships and distress. As romances 
borrowed mostly from myths and fairy tales, they also had a strong didactic tone and depended on a very 
static moral code. Ethical issues are oversimplified, as the world is divided into evil and good forces that are 
in constant battle, characters are either wholly sound or wholly wicked, and the complexity of human 
behaviour is overlooked. 
 

Idealism: 
 

The philosophical belief according to which 
only ideas that are conceived in the mind 

exist in the world.  
The material world is rejected, unless it is 

perceived through human consciousness, and 
reality is basically mentally constructed. 

 In western thought, idealism originates in 
Plato according to whom reality consists of 
ideal immaterial forms existing outside the 

mind, whereas the material world is merely a 
pale reflection of the ideal world. Nineteenth-

century philosophy was dominated by the 
thought of German idealists, such as 

Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Johann 
Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph 

Schelling, and Arthur Schopenhauer.

4.2 The Rise of the Middle Class 

Apart from the mighty aristocracy who owned the land during the Middle Ages, as we have seen, another 
class, the bourgeoisie, began to appear from the eleventh century, especially in the newly developed urban 
areas of the twelfth century (boroughs). The term “bourgeoisie” originally referred to people who had the 
rights of citizenship and political rights in a commercial city. They were merchants, craftsmen, or artisans, 
whose interests clashed with those of the feudal landlords who kept insisting on higher rents in an effort to 
sustain their power and exploit all classes inferior to them. As this newly rising class of merchants and artists 
longed for trade independence and autonomy of thought, they rebelled against the rigidity of feudalism and its 
unchanging emphasis on static property relationships and, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 
developed into the revolutionary class that deposed feudal order.  

118 
 



Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

The bourgeoisie’s demand for commercial rights, personal 
liberty, and the ownership of property ignited the English 
Civil War (1642–51), the American War of 
Independence (1775–83), and the French Revolution (1789–
99). In England, this new progressive class was associated 
with the organizing of the New Model Army, the trial and 
execution of King Charles I, the exile of his son, Charles II, 
and the replacement of English monarchy with, at first, 
the Commonwealth of England (1649–53) and then the 
Protectorate (1653–59) under Oliver Cromwell's personal 
rule. Consequently, the bourgeoisie rejected older forms of 
literature, like the medieval romance and its idealism that 
aimed at strengthening the ruling class, and sought more 
objective means of representation which corresponded to the 
changes in the social order and the needs of the new class. In 
the eighteenth century, as the bourgeoisie gained in strength, 
the novel gained in popularity.

The Battle of Naseby on 14 June 1645 marked the victory of the Parliamentarian New Model Army over 
the Royalist Army and was a significant turning point in the English Civil War. 

Positivism: 
 

The philosophical doctrine that 
predominated in the nineteenth 

century and claimed that the only way 
to acquire knowledge was through 

scientific experimentation and 
observation. Some fundamental 

doctrines of positivism can be traced in 
the theories of Francis Bacon (1561-
1626), George Berkeley (1685-1753), 

and David Hume (1711-1776), but this 
trend took shape in the 1830s when 

Auguste Comte (1798-1857), the 
French mathematician and 

philosopher, rejected metaphysics and 
theology and founded the positivist 

school. Positivism has also been 
associated with empiricism, as it lays 
emphasis on empirical evidence, i.e., 
positive facts perceived through the 

senses and interpreted through 
reasoning processes.

4.3 The Characteristics of the New Genre 

While the bourgeoisie rejected the romance, a genre committed to promoting the feudal system and obscuring 
its limitations by offering readers an ideal substitute for their own lives, they embraced the novel as a new 
form of prose writing that promised to tell the truth about their everyday reality. Although, of course, prose 
fiction had appeared long before the rise of the novel in the eighteenth century, there was at the time a striking 
preference for “true” stories narrated in an unbiased objective mode. This shift from poetry (the genre that 
predominated during the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries) to prose can be justified when one bears in 
mind that, despite the fact that prose is considered to be plain and simple, it is actually a more sophisticated 
and persuasive form of writing. In prose, the spontaneous intuitive emotion of poetry is replaced by conscious 
restraint, as stories strive to represent a consistent portion of external reality.  

The realism of the novel, furthermore, is attuned to Enlightenment thought and the conviction that the 
truth can be discovered by the individual through a process of rational thinking. This thesis has its roots in the 
influential French philosopher René Descartes (1596-1650) who laid the foundations for seventeenth- and 
eighteenth-century rationalism and the modern belief that truth can be achieved only when one relies on 
individual experiences and dissociates oneself from past thought and literary traditionalism. But the most 
ardent advocator of “direct realism” or “common sense realism” was the Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid 
(1710-1796) who opposed any form of idealism and insisted on the existence of an external objective world, 
independent of the perceiving mind. Raid’s “commonsense school” called for realistic approaches in art and 
literature since for positivists an external, objective, material reality actually existed. Another key figure in 
nineteenth-century thought was the French philosopher Auguste Comte, whose works had a major influence 
on Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill and George Eliot. Comte was the founder of the epistemological 
perspective of positivism and the discipline of sociology, as he highlighted the importance of both the physical 
sciences (like mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy), as well as the most complex science of 
human society. 

In its pursuit of truth, the prose fiction of the eighteenth century displays a marked trust in individual 
narratives, base and low characters, everyday themes, and detailed depictions of the material world. That 
which distinguishes the eighteenth-century novels of Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, or 
Lawrence Sterne, for instance, from previous types of literature is a rejection of traditional historical themes 
or plots that relied on myths and legends (as in the works of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser and Milton, for 
example, who borrow their plots from writers of ancient Greece and Rome), and the introduction of 
individualized characters involved in particular circumstances and in many cases facing ordeals which they 
fail to deal with successfully.  

The characters of novels are given a realistic name and surname (like Robinson Crusoe, Tom Jones, 
Clarissa Harlowe, Pamela Andrews, Elisabeth Bennet, David Copperfield, Becky Sharp, etc.) rather than 
historical or general type names that carried fixed predetermined qualities (like Galatea, Aphrodite, Mr. 
Badman, Mrs. Malaprop, etc.). And even when they are suggestive of the character’s overall behaviour (as in 
Mr. Allworthy, Robert Lovelace, or Mrs. Sinclair), they still appear as common everyday-life names. These 
ordinary people are in most cases coming from the lower strata of society and have nothing epic or heroic 
about them; they have more flaws than virtues, are more cowardly than valiant, and more often than not make 
human mistakes. William Makepeace Thackeray’s 1847–48 novel, Vanity Fair, very tellingly subtitled A 
Novel Without a Hero, echoes the novel’s bias against superhuman heroes and heroines and collective 
tradition, as well as its predilection for individualism and novelty. At a time when the word “original” was 
redefined and obtained its modern positive meaning, the novel fractured its ties with the past and opted for 
freshness.

Ian Watt, The Rise of the Novel, “Realism and the Novel Form” 
 
It is significant that the trend in favour of originality found its first powerful expression in 
England, and in the eighteenth century; the very word “original” took on its modern meaning at 
this time, by a semantic reversal which is a parallel to the change in the meaning of “realism”. We 
have seen that, from the medieval belief in the reality of universals, “realism” had come to denote 
a belief in the individual apprehension of reality through the senses: similarly the term “original” 
which in the Middle Ages had meant “having existed from the first” came to mean “underived, 
independent, first-hand”; and by the time that Edward Young in his epoch-making Conjectures on 
Original Composition (1759) ailed Richardson as “a genius as well moral as original”, the word 
could be used as a term of praise meaning “novel or fresh in character or style”. (14) 

 
Notice, for example, how one of the earliest eighteenth-century novels, Daniel Defoe’s 1722 Moll 

Flanders, proclaims its distance from romances that preceded and claims veracity in the Preface that frames, 
what is supposed to be, the true account of the life of the eponymous Moll. The full title of the novel (The 
Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders, &c. Who was Born in Newgate, and during a Life of 
continu'd Variety for Threescore Years, besides her Childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, five times a Wife

(whereof once to her own Brother), Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia, at last 
grew Rich, liv'd Honest, and died a Penitent. Written from her own Memorandums) announces that the book is 
not fiction, but the memoir of a disreputable woman of low origin. As the story is purported to be a detailed 
account of the life of a real person and refer to real-life events, it is considered necessary by Defoe to conceal 
the true names of characters; and since the story is narrated by Moll herself, a former convict in Newgate 
prison involved in a variety of scandalous illicit adventures (such as deceit, whoredom, thievery, felony, 
incest, etc.), its style is slightly altered in order not to shock the reader. Moll’s memorandum, as Daniel Defoe 
explains in the preface, her original account of her eventful life, is presented as it is, with just a minimum 
retouching for the sake of decency. The external author in this case has functioned as an editor of a “true” 
real-life and incomplete narrative, for, as Defoe explains, “nobody can write their own life to the full end of it, 
unless they can write it after they are dead.” 
 

Daniel Defoe, Moll Flanders 
 

The Author’s Preface 
 

The world is so taken up of late with novels and romances, that it will be hard for a private history 
to be taken for genuine, where the names and other circumstances of the person are concealed, and 
on this account we must be content to leave the reader to pass his own opinion upon the ensuing 
sheet, and take it just as he pleases.  

The author is here supposed to be writing her own history, and in the very beginning of 
her account she gives the reasons why she thinks fit to conceal her true name, after which there is 
no occasion to say any more about that. 

It is true that the original of this story is put into new words, and the style of the famous 
lady we here speak of is a little altered; particularly she is made to tell her own tale in modester 
words that she told it at first, the copy which came first to hand having been written in language 
more like one still in Newgate than one grown penitent and humble, as she afterwards pretends to 
be. 

The pen employed in finishing her story, and making it what you now see it to be, has had 
no little difficulty to put it into a dress fit to be seen, and to make it speak language fit to be read. 
When a woman debauched from her youth, nay, even being the offspring of debauchery and vice, 
comes to give an account of all her vicious practices, and even to descend to the particular 
occasions and circumstances by which she ran through in threescore years, an author must be hard 
put to it wrap it up so clean as not to give room, especially for vicious readers, to turn it to his 
disadvantage. 
……………………………………………………………….………………………………………. 

We cannot say, indeed, that this history is carried on quite to the end of the life of this 
famous Moll Flanders, as she calls herself, for nobody can write their own life to the full end of it, 
unless they can write it after they are dead. But her husband’s life, being written by a third hand, 
gives a full account of them both, how long they lived together in that country, and how they both 
came to England again, after about eight years, in which time they were grown very rich, and 
where she lived, it seems, to be very old, but was not so extraordinary a penitent as she was at first; 
it seems only that indeed she always spoke with abhorrence of her former life, and of every part of 
it. 

 
As the novel embraced new plots and focused its lens on the portrayal of low life, it became 

indispensable to set the action and its agents in a specific spatial and temporal background. It is of crucial 
significance in realism that characters operate in a recognizable time period and live in environments that bear 
a close resemblance to real-life surroundings. Consider, for instance, the opening of Felix Holt, George Eliot’s 
1866 social novel, set, as the narrator makes clear in the first sentence of the book, thirty five years before its 
publication, at the time of the First Reform Act of 1832. The novel focuses on the social change in rural towns 

122 
 



Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

across England resulting from the political change the Act caused, as it gave the right to vote to all men 
owning property worth ten pounds or more in annual rent. In this detailed depiction of the old coach roads and 
an imaginary trip across the plain watered by the rivers Avon and Trent, Eliot invites the reader to get a view 
of the wider public life through the private perspective of her imaginary traveler. The profusion of images 
here is striking: acoustic (horns, bells, the shepherd’s cry), olfactory (honeysuckle fragrances), gustatory 
(bread and bacon), tactile (full-uddered cows milked, hoar-frost), and visual (purple blossomed, ruby-berried 
nightshades, scarlet haws, deep-crimson hips, brown leaves). It is though this plethora of sensory details that 
Eliot illuminates the central point made in this passage: before 1832, those boroughs the traveler passes by 
were “unrepresented in Parliament” and “corn laws” (the high tariffs on imported grains that had been 
established in order to protect English farm products from having to compete with low-priced products 
imported from abroad) were still unrepealed. And although the shepherd is unaware of all this, as his “solar 
system” cannot extend beyond his “master’s temper and the casualties of lambing-time,” it is through this 
meticulous depiction of the shepherd’s life that the reader can identify a specific time and place in history and 
relate them to a specific political context.  
 

George Eliot, Felix Holt, the Radical 
 

Introduction 
 
Five-and-thirty years ago the glory had not yet departed from the old coach roads: the great 
roadside inns were still brilliant with well-polished tankards, the smiling glances of pretty 
barmaids, and the repartees of jocose hostlers; the mail still announced itself by the merry notes of 
the horn; the hedge-cutter or the rick-thatcher might still know the exact hour by the unfailing yet 
otherwise meteoric apparition of the pea-green Tally-ho or the yellow Independent; and elderly 
gentlemen in pony-chaises, quartering nervously to make way for the rolling, swinging swiftness, 
had not ceased to remark that times were finely changed since they used to see the pack-horses and 
hear the tinkling of their bells on this very highway. 

In those days there were pocket boroughs, a Birmingham unrepresented in Parliament and 
compelled to make strong representations out of it, unrepealed corn-laws, three-and-sixpenny 
letters, a brawny and many-breeding pauperism, and other departed evils; but there were some 
pleasant things, too, which have also departed. Non omnia grandior aetas, quae fugiamus habet, 
says the wise goddess: you have not the best of it in all things, O youngsters! the elderly man has 
his enviable memories, and not the least of them is the memory of a long journey in mid-spring or 
autumn on the outside of a stage coach. Posterity may be shot, like a bullet through a tube, by 
atmospheric pressure, from Winchester to Newcastle: that is a fine result to have among our hopes; 
but the slow, old fashioned way of getting from one end of our country to the other is the better 
thing to have in the memory. The tube-journey can never lend much to picture and narrative; it is as 
barren as an exclamatory O! Whereas, the happy outside passenger, seated on the box from the 
dawn to the gloaming, gathered enough stories of English life, enough of English labors in town 
and country, enough aspects of earth and sky, to make episodes for a modern Odyssey. Suppose 
only that his journey took him through that central plain, watered at one extremity by the Avon, at 
the other by the Trent. As the morning silvered the meadows with their long lines of bushy willows 
marking the water-courses, or burnished the golden corn-ricks clustered near the long roofs of 
some midland homestead, he saw the full-uddered cows driven from their pasture to the early 
milking. Perhaps it was the shepherd, head-servant of the farm, who drove them, his sheep-dog 
following with a heedless, unofficial air, as of a beadle in undress. The shepherd, with a slow and 
slouching walk, timed by the walk of grazing beasts, moved aside, as if unwillingly, throwing out a 
monosyllabic hint to his cattle; his glance, accustomed to rest on things very near the earth, seemed 
to lift itself with difficulty to the coachman. Mail or stage coach for him belonged to the mysterious 
distant system of things called “Gover'ment,” which, whatever it might be, was no business of his, 
any more than the most outlying nebula or the coal-sacks of the southern hemisphere: his solar

system was the parish; the master’s temper and the casualties of lambing-time were his region of 
storms. He cut his bread and bacon with his pocket-knife, and felt no bitterness except in the matter 
of pauper laborers and the bad-luck that sent contrarious seasons and the sheep-rot. He and his 
cows were soon left behind, and the homestead, too, with its pond overhung by elder-trees, its 
untidy kitchen-garden and cone-shaped yew-tree arbor. But everywhere the bushy hedgerows 
wasted the land with their straggling beauty, shrouded the grassy borders of the pastures with 
catkined hazels, and tossed their long blackberry branches on the corn-fields. Perhaps they were 
white with May, or starred with pale pink dog-roses; perhaps the urchins were already nutting 
among them, or gathering the plenteous crabs. It was worth the journey only to see those 
hedgerows, the liberal homes of unmarketable beauty—of the purple blossomed, ruby-berried 
nightshade, of the wild convolvulus climbing and spreading in tendriled strength till it made a great 
curtain of pale-green hearts and white trumpets, of the many-tubed honey-suckle which, in its most 
delicate fragrance, hid a charm more subtle and penetrating than beauty. Even if it were winter, the 
hedgerows showed their coral, the scarlet haws, the deep-crimson hips, with lingering brown leaves 
to make a resting-place for the jewels of the hoar-frost. Such hedgerows were often as tall as the 
laborers’ cottages dotted along the lanes, or clustered into a small hamlet, their little dingy 
windows telling, like thick-filmed eyes, of nothing but the darkness within. 

5. George Eliot’s Realist Manifesto 

This physical concreteness and accumulation of material data, as well as the turn to the low and sordid aspect 
of life, manifest the closeness of realist fiction to the nineteenth-century realist paintings we have already 
examined and also to the Dutch and Flemish painting schools from the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries. 
The most ardent supporter of realism in nineteenth-century England, George Eliot, expresses her preference 
for the truthfulness of Dutch painting and in general this taste for the humble and the ordinary which has been 
one of the trademarks of realism. In Chapter 17 of her first novel, Adam Bede, published in 1859, Eliot’s 
narrator breaks for a moment the illusion of fiction in order to address her reader directly and defend her 
refusal to retouch and beautify the life she describes. Although her readers would have preferred her to 
improve facts and rectify the portrait of her “tasteless and indiscreet” characters, like that of Adolphus Irwine, 
the Rector of Broxton, the narrator insists on giving a “faithful account of men and things” and representing 
their complexity rather than simply casting them as either wrong or virtuous. Her aim is not to create a 
seamless version of the world, but to discover the splendor of coarseness and vulgarity and provide insight 
into the infinite potential that people have to surprise us (like Mrs. Green, the neighbor “who was really kind 
to you in your last illness, but has said several ill-natured things about you since your convalescence”).  

It is not celestial angels, heroic warriors, or divine Madonnas that fascinate her, but old women with 
weather-beaten faces engaged in dull activities like scraping potatoes in a dingy kitchen full of tin pans and 
clusters of onions. In this realist manifesto, Eliot links her aesthetics with the aesthetics of Jan van 
Eyck, Pieter Brueghel, Jan Steen, Jan Vermeer, and numerous other Dutch and Flemish painters who were 
devoted to what she calls in The Mill on the Floss the most prosaic, “emmet-like” aspect of life (Book Fourth, 
Chapter 1). Like those past masters, Eliot discovers the poetry and tragic potential of people “irradiated by no 
sublime principles, no romantic visions, no active, self renouncing faith” (The Mill on the Floss). There is 
grace and magnificence in the worldliness of a kitchen maid pouring milk from a jug (see Jan Vermeer’s The 
Kitchen Maid), or a disorderly assemblage of unattractive peasants absorbed in ungainly dancing (see Pieter 
Brueghel II’s Peasant Wedding Dance), as there is in the mundaneness of Eliot’s characters. Eliot’s candid 
pen scrapes off the veneer of artificiality and convention to disclose the “oppressive narrowness” (The Mill on 
the Floss) which lies in the very heart of life and which she adores.

Chapter XVII 
In Which the Story Pauses a Little 

 
“This Rector of Broxton is little better than a pagan!” I hear one of my readers exclaim. “How 
much more edifying it would have been if you had made him give Arthur some truly spiritual 
advice! You might have put into his mouth the most beautiful things—quite as good as reading a 
sermon.” 

Certainly I could, if I held it the highest vocation of the novelist to represent things as they 
never have been and never will be. Then, of course, I might refashion life and character entirely 
after my own liking; I might select the most unexceptionable type of clergyman and put my own 
admirable opinions into his mouth on all occasions. But it happens, on the contrary, that my 
strongest effort is to avoid any such arbitrary picture, and to give a faithful account of men and 
things as they have mirrored themselves in my mind. The mirror is doubtless defective, the 
outlines will sometimes be disturbed, the reflection faint or confused; but I feel as much bound to 
tell you as precisely as I can what that reflection is, as if I were in the witness-box, narrating my 
experience on oath. 

Sixty years ago—it is a long time, so no wonder things have changed—all clergymen were 
not zealous; indeed, there is reason to believe that the number of zealous clergymen was small, 
and it is probable that if one among the small minority had owned the livings of Broxton and 
Hayslope in the year 1799, you would have liked him no better than you like Mr. Irwine. Ten to 
one, you would have thought him a tasteless, indiscreet, methodistical man. It is so very rarely that 
facts hit that nice medium required by our own enlightened opinions and refined taste! Perhaps 
you will say, “Do improve the facts a little, then; make them more accordant with those correct 
views which it is our privilege to possess. The world is not just what we like; do touch it up with a 

126 
 



Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

tasteful pencil, and make believe it is not quite such a mixed entangled affair. Let all people who 
hold unexceptionable opinions act unexceptionably. Let your most faulty characters always be on 
the wrong side, and your virtuous ones on the right. Then we shall see at a glance whom we are to 
condemn and whom we are to approve. Then we shall be able to admire, without the slightest 
disturbance of our prepossessions: we shall hate and despise with that true ruminant relish which 
belongs to undoubting confidence.” 

But, my good friend, what will you do then with your fellow-parishioner who opposes your 
husband in the vestry? With your newly appointed vicar, whose style of preaching you find 
painfully below that of his regretted predecessor? With the honest servant who worries your soul 
with her one failing? With your neighbour, Mrs. Green, who was really kind to you in your last 
illness, but has said several ill-natured things about you since your convalescence? Nay, with your 
excellent husband himself, who has other irritating habits besides that of not wiping his shoes? 
These fellow-mortals, every one, must be accepted as they are: you can neither straighten their 
noses, nor brighten their wit, nor rectify their dispositions; and it is these people—amongst whom 
your life is passed—that it is needful you should tolerate, pity, and love: it is these more or less 
ugly, stupid, inconsistent people whose movements of goodness you should be able to admire—
for whom you should cherish all possible hopes, all possible patience. And I would not, even if I 
had the choice, be the clever novelist who could create a world so much better than this, in which 
we get up in the morning to do our daily work, that you would be likely to turn a harder, colder 
eye on the dusty streets and the common green fields—on the real breathing men and women, who 
can be chilled by your indifference or injured by your prejudice; who can be cheered and helped 
onward by your fellow-feeling, your forbearance, your outspoken, brave justice. 

So I am content to tell my simple story, without trying to make things seem better than they 
were; dreading nothing, indeed, but falsity, which, in spite of one’s best efforts, there is reason to 
dread. Falsehood is so easy, truth so difficult. The pencil is conscious of a delightful facility in 
drawing a griffin—the longer the claws, and the larger the wings, the better; but that marvellous 
facility which we mistook for genius is apt to forsake us when we want to draw a real 
unexaggerated lion. Examine your words well, and you will find that even when you have no 
motive to be false, it is a very hard thing to say the exact truth, even about your own immediate 
feelings—much harder than to say something fine about them which is NOT the exact truth. 

It is for this rare, precious quality of truthfulness that I delight in many Dutch paintings, 
which lofty-minded people despise. I find a source of delicious sympathy in these faithful pictures 
of a monotonous homely existence, which has been the fate of so many more among my fellow-
mortals than a life of pomp or of absolute indigence, of tragic suffering or of world-stirring 
actions. I turn, without shrinking, from cloud-borne angels, from prophets, sibyls, and heroic 
warriors, to an old woman bending over her flower-pot, or eating her solitary dinner, while the 
noonday light, softened perhaps by a screen of leaves, falls on her mob-cap, and just touches the 
rim of her spinning-wheel, and her stone jug, and all those cheap common things which are the 
precious necessaries of life to her—or I turn to that village wedding, kept between four brown 
walls, where an awkward bridegroom opens the dance with a high-shouldered, broad-faced bride, 
while elderly and middle-aged friends look on, with very irregular noses and lips, and probably 
with quart-pots in their hands, but with an expression of unmistakable contentment and goodwill. 
“Foh!” says my idealistic friend, “what vulgar details! What good is there in taking all these pains 
to give an exact likeness of old women and clowns? What a low phase of life! What clumsy, ugly 
people!” 

But bless us, things may be lovable that are not altogether handsome, I hope? I am not at all 
sure that the majority of the human race have not been ugly, and even among those “lords of their 
kind,” the British, squat figures, ill-shapen nostrils, and dingy complexions are not startling 
exceptions. Yet there is a great deal of family love amongst us. I have a friend or two whose class 
of features is such that the Apollo curl on the summit of their brows would be decidedly trying; 
yet to my certain knowledge tender hearts have beaten for them, and their miniatures—flattering, 
but still not lovely—are kissed in secret by motherly lips. I have seen many an excellent matron, 
who could have never in her best days have been handsome, and yet she had a packet of yellow 
love-letters in a private drawer, and sweet children showered kisses on her sallow cheeks. And I 
believe there have been plenty of young heroes, of middle stature and feeble beards, who have felt 

127 
 



Katerina Kitsi-Mitakou 
 

quite sure they could never love anything more insignificant than a Diana, and yet have found 
themselves in middle life happily settled with a wife who waddles. Yes! Thank God; human 
feeling is like the mighty rivers that bless the earth: it does not wait for beauty—it flows with 
resistless force and brings beauty with it. 

All honour and reverence to the divine beauty of form! Let us cultivate it to the utmost in 
men, women, and children—in our gardens and in our houses. But let us love that other beauty 
too, which lies in no secret of proportion, but in the secret of deep human sympathy. Paint us an 
angel, if you can, with a floating violet robe, and a face paled by the celestial light; paint us yet 
oftener a Madonna, turning her mild face upward and opening her arms to welcome the divine 
glory; but do not impose on us any aesthetic rules which shall banish from the region of Art those 
old women scraping carrots with their work-worn hands, those heavy clowns taking holiday in a 
dingy pot-house, those rounded backs and stupid weather-beaten faces that have bent over the 
spade and done the rough work of the world—those homes with their tin pans, their brown 
pitchers, their rough curs, and their clusters of onions. In this world there are so many of these 
common coarse people, who have no picturesque sentimental wretchedness! It is so needful we 
should remember their existence, else we may happen to leave them quite out of our religion and 
philosophy and frame lofty theories which only fit a world of extremes. Therefore, let Art always 
remind us of them; therefore let us always have men ready to give the loving pains of a life to the 
faithful representing of commonplace things—men who see beauty in these commonplace things, 
and delight in showing how kindly the light of heaven falls on them. There are few prophets in the 
world; few sublimely beautiful women; few heroes. I can't afford to give all my love and 
reverence to such rarities: I want a great deal of those feelings for my every-day fellow-men, 
especially for the few in the foreground of the great multitude, whose faces I know, whose hands I 
touch, for whom I have to make way with kindly courtesy. Neither are picturesque lazzaroni or 
romantic criminals half so frequent as your common labourer, who gets his own bread and eats it 
vulgarly but creditably with his own pocket-knife. It is more needful that I should have a fibre of 
sympathy connecting me with that vulgar citizen who weighs out my sugar in a vilely assorted 
cravat and waistcoat, than with the handsomest rascal in red scarf and green feathers—more 
needful that my heart should swell with loving admiration at some trait of gentle goodness in the 
faulty people who sit at the same hearth with me, or in the clergyman of my own parish, who is 
perhaps rather too corpulent and in other respects is not an Oberlin or a Tillotson, than at the deeds 
of heroes whom I shall never know except by hearsay, or at the sublimest abstract of all clerical 
graces that was ever conceived by an able novelist. 

6. The Defective Mirror 

The descent of realism to themes, characters and settings that had been considered by other movements in art 
and literature prosaic and uninspiring is interrelated with the mode of representation favoured in realism. It is 
not just the subject matter of realistic stories that is faithfully drawn from a real-life reservoir; the voice that 
narrates is also directed towards objectivity and aims at achieving the detached approach of the scientist who 
observes the world rather than that of a partial commentator who guides the reader towards certain 
conclusions. The writer in realism strives to abstain from partialities or personal prejudices that would make 
him or her steer away from facts. In tune with eighteenth-century philosophies of Enlightenment and 
nineteenth-century positivism that acknowledged experimental investigation and observation as the only 
sources of knowledge, the realist writer, like a methodical and impersonal scientist, is supposed to observe the 
world and document facts, holding up a mirror to reality and offering to the reader a slice of truth. The mirror 
became a key metaphor in nineteenth-century realism, as it best defined the role of realist literature and art. 
The French critic Fernand Desnoyers very characteristically writes in his 1855 declaration “On Realism”: “I 
demand for painting and for literature the same rights as mirrors have” (quoted in Becker 82). 

128 
 



Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

 Yet, the mirror image, even for nineteenth-century writers, was a crude simplification. Evidently, the 
medium of literature could never function as the flat surface of a looking glass that simply generates copies of 
the world. George Henry Lewes, another fervent proponent of realism, philosopher, and critic of literature, 
was well aware of this, when in 1858, he argued that, since every mode of representation presupposes a 

medium, representation is always bound to and “limited by the 
nature of its medium” (493). Lewes’ life-long partner, George 
Eliot, honestly declares the limitations of her medium when, in 
her realist manifesto, she speaks of a “defective” mirror. Like a 
witness in the courtroom, who is bound by oath to tell the truth, 
Eliot on the one hand vows to “give a faithful account of men 
and things as they have mirrored themselves in [her] mind,” 
while on the other hand she confesses that, in the mirror of her 
mind, “the outlines will sometimes be disturbed, the reflection 
faint or confused.”  

The defective mirror image has been crucial in the 
theory of realism, as it reveals the paradoxical nature of the 
term: its potential to convey a faithful picture of reality but also 
its failure in performing this task successfully. No matter how 
hard a writer may strive for objectivity, if the world is always 
filtered through his or her mind, it will always be coloured by 
his or her personal perspective. Even the writer who makes the 
most compelling and sincere effort to monitor and document 
reality with the impartiality of a scientist is always involved in 
processes like selecting his or her data, deciding about the order 
in which they will be presented, transmitting them to the reader 
through the voice of one (or more) narrator(s), and employing 
language in order to do so. Eliot’s defective mirror, in an 
interesting way, anticipates twentieth-century criticism of 
realism, as we will see later on in this chapter, and is also proof 
that the approach of nineteenth-century realists is not naïve or 
ignorant of the complications that the “I am a camera” metaphor 
had. Even in photography, which developed at around the same 
time, in mid-nineteenth century, and promised unprecedented 
correctness and precision, the personal shortcomings of the 

person behind the camera could not be eliminated. In her study Fiction in the Age of Photography, for 
example, Nancy Armstrong has shown how certain poses for portraits of women, criminals, or native people 
in nineteenth-century photography were utilized to suggest their inferiority and promoted discriminatory 
sexist or racial views. Eliot’s recognition of the subjective fallibilities of the author manifests that her 
insistence on realism is anything but artless or unstudied.  

7. Literalism, Photographic Realism, Materialism 

Unlike romances that present an idealized version of the world, as we have seen already, realist fiction is 
committed to truth. It is exactly this devotion to truth, a much contested term among philosophers, that renders 
realism such a complex and hard to define concept. In his 1970 book, Realism, Damian Grant distinguishes 
between scientific and poetic truth and the two contrasting and complementary approaches to it: the empirical 
and epistemological method of scientists, which he technically refers to as “the correspondence theory,” and 
intuitive perception, which is associated with “the coherence theory.” In the former case, it is taken for 
granted that there is a factual reality which exists a priori and can be captured through careful observation and 
meticulous reproduction of a simulacrum that corresponds to an external original reality. The artist here is 
conscientiously loyal to an external world already there; his or her conscience, in other words, protests when 
external reality is neglected. In contrast, in the latter case, the task of the artist is not to seize, but to discover 

Mimesis: 
 

The word originally denoted the 
human behaviour of miming or 

mimicking something. Since Plato 
and Aristotle, it has been associated 
with artistic representation, as, like 
people who imitate each other, art 
imitates the world. The question of 
how accurately a work of art can 

imitate life has been central to 
Western thought and verisimilitude 

has in various contexts been 
regarded as the correct way of 

painting or writing. In the twentieth 
century, many influential theorists 

have considered mimesis a primary, 
rather than secondary, activity 

directly associated with issues of 
identity, language and desire. 

According to them, we shape our 
identities, gender behaviour or racial 

differences, for example, through 
unconscious identification with 

certain models that prevail in certain 
times and places.

and release the truth, by consciously trusting his or her instinct and imaginative abilities. Truth here is created 
and need not correspond to any preexisting world, but cohere and make sense as the artist is self-aware of 
realism and its ontological status (physical existence).  

A number of critics have conflated realism with the conscientious manner of mimicking appearances, 
so it has often been alleged that realism’s strength rests on a work’s power of illusion. Since Plato’s Republic, 
a work which initiates the idea of mimesis in Western culture in 380 BCE, art has been characterized as an 
imitation of the real world. In book seven of the Republic, Plato presents his well-known “allegory of the 
cave,” according to which truth resides only in ideas. Human beings are like prisoners chained in a cave 
sitting with their back to its opening and watching the reflections of the real world on its walls. Although they 
can observe only shadows of the things that happen outside the cave, they believe that what they see is the real 
world, as this is what they have known since birth. When, in very rare cases, a prisoner breaks his [sic] chain, 
Plato claims through the voice of Socrates, he [sic] can look at the sun directly and catch a glimpse of the real 
world. This is the true philosopher, for the real world is the world of ideas, not material things, and it is only 
philosophers that can approach it. In contrast to philosophers, who reach truth, artists in Book Ten of the 
Republic can only produce “phantoms,” shadows of the things they imitate, or, more precisely, shadows of 
shadows, as, like all mortals, artists too are captives in this cave and perceive only reflections. All they are 
able to do is mechanically reproduce replicas of people, animals, plants and everything in heaven and earth, in 
the manner of a mirror that automatically sends out duplicates of shadows. Artistic representation, twice 
distanced from truth and a threat to knowledge, is in this sense a superfluous, histrionic, inferior and harmful 
activity and artists should be banned from Plato’s ideal city, in order for artistic contamination to be 
eliminated. 

Plato’s theory of art as mimesis has left an indelible mark on Western aesthetics and accounts for the 
Western attachment to realism throughout the centuries. It also explains the reduction of realistic 
representation in certain cases to literalism or photographic realism, a mode directly related with the 
correspondence theory of realism discussed above. This obsession with imitative exactness is best reflected in 
the classical tale of the two ancient painters Zeuxis and Parrhasius, recorded in Pliny’s Natural History, who 

130 
 



Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

are competing with each other over who can produce the most lifelike and convincing painting. Zeuxis is 
overconfident that he has won the match, as the bunch of grapes he has painted has fooled even the birds that 
flew down to nibble them. Parrhasius takes him by surprise, however, when Zeuxis attempts to draw the 
curtain he thinks is covering Parrhasius’ painting and discovers that it is nothing but a painted veil. This 
trompe-l’oeil, as it is called in French, technique of depicting objects or people in three dimensions in order to 
deceive the eye, is resonant of Plato’s mimetic function of art and has been much in vogue throughout the 
history of painting, murals, sculpture or architecture.

The technique of trompe-l’oeil is evident also in 3D Street Art which is gaining much 
popularity in our days. It presents startling views that delude the viewer into believing that 

there is a third dimension in a two-dimensional drawing, as in the artwork posted here.

In literature, the medium of representation is language and, therefore, correspondence to the material 
world is less evident than in the visual arts. As Edgar Allan Poe observed while commenting on the 
Daguerreotype process which was the origin of modern photography: 
 

All language must fall short of conveying any just idea of the truth, and this will not appear 
so wonderful when we reflect that the source of vision itself has been, in this instance, the 
designer. Perhaps, if we imagine the distinctness with which an object is reflected in a 
positively perfect mirror, we come as near the reality as by any other means. For, in truth, the 
Daguerreotyped plate is infinitely (we use the term advisedly) is infinitely more accurate in 
its representation than any painting by human hands.  

 
When conscientious realism contests with photography in presenting a simulacrum of reality, it very 

often degenerates into literalism, photographic realism, or, what Virginia Woolf has called, “materialism.” In 
her 1925 essay “Modern Fiction,” Woolf attacks the slavish insistence on accuracy which smothers life and 
which is epitomized in the novels of the Edwardian writers of the late nineteenth century. Writers like Arnold 
Bennett (1867-1931), John Galsworthy (1867-1933), or H. G. Wells (1866-1946) focus exclusively on the 
external material world, but real life escapes them, she argues:  

 
So much of the enormous labour of proving the solidity, the likeness to life, of the story is 
not merely labour thrown away but labour misplaced to the extent of obscuring and blotting 
out the light of the conception. The writer seems constrained, not by his own free will but by 
some powerful and unscrupulous tyrant who has him in thrall, to provide a plot, to provide 
comedy, tragedy, love interest, and an air of probability embalming the whole so impeccable 
that if all his figures were to come to life they would find themselves dressed down to the 
last button of their coats in the fashion of the hour. The tyrant is obeyed; the novel is done to 
a turn. But sometimes, more and more often as time goes by, we suspect a momentary doubt, 
a spasm of rebellion, as the pages fill themselves in the customary way. Is life like this? Must 
novels be like this? 
 
Their characters may live in perfectly constructed houses, but they are really dead, choked by the 

conglomeration of innumerable trivial details, while their true spirit has eluded the writer. This is justified in 
the extensive quotation inserted in Woolf’s essay from Arnold Bennet’s novel Hilda Lessways. The 
exhausting description of the view from the main character’s window and all the tedious information about 
houses, rents, Victorian economics, terraces, etc. are mere digressions from the truth. 

 

Virginia Woolf, from “Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown” 
 
But then he [Arnold Bennet] begins to describe, not Hilda Lessways, but the view from her 
bedroom window, the excuse being that Mr. Skellorn, the man who collects rents, is coming along 
that way. Mr. Bennett proceeds:  

“The bailiwick of Turnhill lay behind her; and all the murky district of the Five Towns, of 
which Turnhill is the northern outpost, lay to the south. At the foot of Chatterley Wood the canal 
wound in large curves on its way towards the undefiled plains of Cheshire and the sea. On the 
canal-side, exactly opposite to Hilda’s window, was a flour-mill, that sometimes made nearly as 
much smoke as the kilns and the chimneys closing the prospect on either hand. From the flourmill a 
bricked path, which separated a considerable row of new cottages from their appurtenant gardens, 
led straight into Lessways Street, in front of Mrs. Lessways’ house. By this path Mr. Skellorn 
should have arrived, for he inhabited the farthest of the cottages.” One line of insight would have 
done more than all those lines of description; but let them pass as the necessary drudgery of the 
novelist. And now—where is Hilda? Alas. Hilda is still looking out of the window. Passionate and 
dissatisfied as she was, she was a girl with an eye for houses. She often compared this old Mr. 

132 
 



Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

Skellorn with the villas she saw from her bedroom window. Therefore the villas must be described. 
Mr. Bennett proceeds: “The row was called Freehold Villas: a consciously proud name in a district 
where much of the land was copyhold and could only change owners subject to the payment of 4 
fines,' and to the feudal consent of a ‘court’ presided over by the agent of a lord of the manor. Most 
of the dwellings were owned by their occupiers, who, each an absolute monarch of the soil, niggled 
in his sooty garden of an evening amid the flutter of drying shirts and towels. Freehold Villas 
symbolised the final triumph of Victorian economics, the apotheosis of the prudent and industrious 
artisan. It corresponded with a Building Society Secretary’s dream of paradise. And indeed it was a 
very real achievement. Nevertheless, Hilda’s irrational contempt would not admit this.” Heaven be 
praised, we cry! At last we are coming to Hilda herself. But not so fast. Hilda may have been this, 
that, and the other; but Hilda not only looked at houses, and thought of houses; Hilda lived in a 
house. And what sort of a house did Hilda live in? Mr. Bennett proceeds: “It was one of the two 
middle houses of a detached terrace of four houses built by her grandfather Lessways, the teapot 
manufacturer; it was the chief of the four, obviously the habitation of the proprietor of the terrace. 
One of the corner houses comprised a grocer’s shop, and this house had been robbed of its just 
proportion of garden so that the seigneurial garden-plot might be triflingly larger than the other. 
The terrace was not a terrace of cottages, but of houses rated at from twenty-six to thirty-six pounds 
a year; beyond the means of artisans and petty insurance agents and rent-collectors. And further, it 
was well built, generously built; and its architecture, though debased, showed some faint traces of 
Georgian amenity. It was admittedly the best row of houses in that newly settled quarter of the 
town. In coming to it out of Freehold Villas Mr. Skellorn obviously came to something superior, 
wider, more liberal. Suddenly Hilda heard her mother’s voice” […] But we cannot hear her 
mother’s voice, or Hilda’s voice; we can only hear Mr. Bennett’s voice telling us facts about rents 
and freeholds and copyholds and fines. 

 
Woolf best exemplifies the modernist critique of realism, which began with the fin-de-siècle writers, 

and gained vigor in the first decades of the twentieth century. In the late Victorian period, for example, Oscar 
Wilde’s aesthetic philosophy rejected realism as philistine materialism. The purpose of art, Wilde provokingly 
declares, is not to echo life, but to lie about life, not to show us its morbid revolting face, but to retouch it 
according to the ideal of beauty. In his dialogue, “The Decay of Lying” (1889), Wilde seems to take sides 
with Plato’s views on the artificiality of art; unlike Plato, though, he claims that artistic lies are the apex of 
beauty, delight and pleasure. For Wilde, it is not art that should be committed to life, but life that should 
imitate art. In the early twentieth century, along with Woolf, a whole range of modernist writers, like Joseph 
Conrad, E. M. Foster, James Joyce, Katherine Mansfield, or D. H. Lawrence (to name but a few), questioned 
the doctrine of realism. As they wrote at a time when science underlined its limitations and uncertainties, 
when both material and psychological reality was elusive, and absolute truths were pronounced dead, 
modernists derided both the realists’ exertion to attain truth and their means of achieving this goal. 
 

Virginia Woolf, from “Modern Fiction” 
 

Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life is a luminous halo, a semi-
transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end. Is it not the 
task of the novelist to convey this varying, this unknown and uncircumscribed spirit, whatever 
aberration or complexity it may display, with as little mixture of the alien and external as possible? 
We are not pleading merely for courage and sincerity; we are suggesting that the proper stuff of 
fiction is a little other than custom would have us believe it.

8. “Tell All the Truth, but Tell it Slant—”: The Paradox of Realism 

Even seen from the perspective of twentieth-century modernists, however, the excerpt from Arnold Bennett’s 
novel which Woolf quotes from is not representative of a variety of nineteenth-century novels whose attitude 
towards reality is anything but unsophisticated. Let us consider, for example, the rawest case of 
representational realism that finds its expression in nineteenth-century fiction. This is Mr. Gradgrind’s 
reiterating decree in Charles Dickens’s Hard Times: “Now, what I want, is Facts. Teach these boys and girls 
nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life.” The students in Mr. Gradgrind’s factual school, trained to 
perceive the world through “a pair of scales and the multiplication table always,” are mere vessels filled to the 
brim with “imperial gallons of facts.” Deprived since birth of anything that would nurture their imaginative 
flair and brought up without nursery rhymes or fairy tales, his students learn that everything is to be calculated 
in numbers and explained through statistics. Hence the model definition of a horse which consists only of dull 
factual information and numbers. Here it is, forced on them by the model student in Mr. Gradgrind’s class in 
the second chapter of Hard Times:  
 

“Quadruped. Graminivorous. Forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders, four eye-teeth, and 
twelve incisive. Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy countries, sheds hoofs, too. Hoofs hard, 
but requiring to be shod with iron. Age known by marks in mouth.” 
 
In his classroom aesthetics also, students are instructed that any trace of fancy needs to be expelled. 

According to Mr. Gradgrind’s factual philosophy, animate or inanimate things must be locked in their 
denotative meanings and any effort to “misplace” them must be crushed from the roots. We cannot paper our 
walls with horse images or decorate our carpets with flowers or our china with butterflies, Mr. Gradgrind 
reasons nonsensically, as quadrupeds can never trot the sides of rooms in reality, insects never perch on 
tableware and flowers would wither if people put tables and chairs on them.  
 

Charles Dickens, Hard Times 
 

Chapter II 
 
“Very well,” said this gentleman, briskly smiling, and folding his arms. “That’s a horse. Now, 

let me ask you girls and boys, Would you paper a room with representations of horses?” 
After a pause, one half of the children cried in chorus, “Yes, sir!” Upon which the other half, 

seeing in the gentleman’s face that Yes was wrong, cried out in chorus, “No, sir!”—as the custom 
is, in these examinations. 

“Of course, No. Why wouldn’t you?” 
A pause. One corpulent slow boy, with a wheezy manner of breathing, ventured the answer, 

Because he wouldn’t paper a room at all, but would paint it. 
“You must paper it,” said the gentleman, rather warmly. 
“You must paper it,” said Thomas Gradgrind, “whether you like it or not. Don’t tell us you 

wouldn’t paper it. What do you mean, boy?” 
“I’ll explain to you, then,” said the gentleman, after another and a dismal pause, “why you 

wouldn’t paper a room with representations of horses. Do you ever see horses walking up and 
down the sides of rooms in reality—in fact? Do you?” 

“Yes, sir!” from one half. “No, sir!” from the other. 
“Of course no,” said the gentleman, with an indignant look at the wrong half. “Why, then, you 

are not to see anywhere, what you don’t see in fact; you are not to have anywhere, what you don’t 
have in fact. What is called Taste, is only another name for Fact.” Thomas Gradgrind nodded his 
approbation. 

“This is a new principle, a discovery, a great discovery,” said the gentleman. “Now, I’ll try you 
again. Suppose you were going to carpet a room. Would you use a carpet having a representation 
of flowers upon it?” 

134 
 



Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

There being a general conviction by this time that “No, sir!” was always the right answer to 
this gentleman, the chorus of No was very strong. Only a few feeble stragglers said Yes: among 
them Sissy Jupe. 

“Girl number twenty,” said the gentleman, smiling in the calm strength of knowledge. 
Sissy blushed, and stood up. 
“So you would carpet your room—or your husband’s room, if you were a grown woman, and 

had a husband—with representations of flowers, would you?” said the gentleman. “Why would 
you?” 

“If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers,” returned the girl. 
“And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them, and have people walking over 

them with heavy boots?” 
“It wouldn’t hurt them, sir. They wouldn’t crush and wither, if you please, sir. They would be 

the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant, and I would fancy—” 
“Ay, ay, ay! But you mustn’t fancy,” cried the gentleman, quite elated by coming so happily to 

his point. “That’s it! You are never to fancy.” 
“You are not, Cecilia Jupe,” Thomas Gradgrind solemnly repeated, “to do anything of that 

kind.” 
“Fact, fact, fact!” said the gentleman. And “Fact, fact, fact!” repeated Thomas Gradgrind. 
“You are to be in all things regulated and governed,” said the gentleman, “by fact. We hope to 

have, before long, a board of fact, composed of commissioners of fact, who will force the people to 
be a people of fact, and of nothing but fact. You must discard the word Fancy altogether. You have 
nothing to do with it. You are not to have, in any object of use or ornament, what would be a 
contradiction in fact. You don’t walk upon flowers in fact; you cannot be allowed to walk upon 
flowers in carpets. You don’t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your 
crockery; you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery. You 
never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls; you must not have quadrupeds represented 
upon walls. You must use,” said the gentleman, “for all these purposes, combinations and 
modifications (in primary colours) of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and 
demonstration. This is the new discovery. This is fact. This is taste.” 

The girl curtseyed, and sat down. She was very young, and she looked as if she were 
frightened by the matter-of-fact prospect the world afforded. 

“Now, if Mr. M’Choakumchild,” said the gentleman, “will proceed to give his first lesson here, 
Mr. Gradgrind, I shall be happy, at your request, to observe his mode of procedure.” 

Mr. Gradgrind was much obliged. “Mr. M’Choakumchild, we only wait for you.” 
So, Mr. M’Choakumchild began in his best manner. He and some one hundred and forty other 

schoolmasters, had been lately turned at the same time, in the same factory, on the same principles, 
like so many pianoforte legs. He had been put through an immense variety of paces, and had 
answered volumes of head-breaking questions. Orthography, etymology, syntax, and prosody, 
biography, astronomy, geography, and general cosmography, the sciences of compound proportion, 
algebra, land-surveying and levelling, vocal music, and drawing from models, were all at the ends 
of his ten chilled fingers. He had worked his stony way into Her Majesty’s most Honourable Privy 
Council’s Schedule B, and had taken the bloom off the higher branches of mathematics and 
physical science, French, German, Latin, and Greek. He knew all about all the Water Sheds of all 
the world (whatever they are), and all the histories of all the peoples, and all the names of all the 
rivers and mountains, and all the productions, manners, and customs of all the countries, and all 
their boundaries and bearings on the two and thirty points of the compass. Ah, rather overdone, 
M’Choakumchild. If he had only learnt a little less, how infinitely better he might have taught 
much more! 

He went to work in this preparatory lesson, not unlike Morgiana in the Forty Thieves: looking 
into all the vessels ranged before him, one after another, to see what they contained. Say, good 
M’Choakumchild. When from thy boiling store, thou shalt fill each jar brim full by-and-by, dost 
thou think that thou wilt always kill outright the robber Fancy lurking within—or sometimes only 
maim him and distort him!

It is, however, exactly this uninspired bland attitude that Dickens’s novel cauterizes. Although Hard Times is 
realistic to the bone in the sense that it refers to a very particular time period in England and deals with some 
hot debates of the mid-Victorian period (like the “Condition of England Question,” the educational system 
and utilitarianism), the mode of representation selected by Dickens deviates from realism and borrows from a 
variety of other genres.  

On the one hand, Hard Times focuses on some very characteristic aspects of mid-Victorian England. 
The classroom scenes in the beginning of the novel, for instance, are distinct echoes of the teaching system in 
schools: in huge classrooms, about one thousand students were arranged in a military way and controlled by 
monitors and a monitor-general; students had numbers and were taught to memorize blocks of factual 
knowledge in a mechanical way. The setting of the novel also, Coketown, is an exact copy of the monotonous, 
hellish industrial cities which were mushrooming at the time and dehumanized their inhabitants. Moreover, 
the part of the plot referring to the mill workers and their combining in unions faithfully demonstrates the 
conditions of the working class people: as an aftermath of the laissez faire or Free Trade economic system of 
the time (that was based on the assumption that the government should not interfere at all with the running of 
factories), the poor were prey to exploitation by capital owners. Dickens’s effort to be precise about the world 
he described is evident in the unprecedented emphasis he gave to observation as recorded in his letters. We 
know for example that he had visited Preston, a textile-manufacturing town in the North of England in order 
to collect data and form an opinion about trade unions and the weavers’ strike that broke out there in 1853, a 
year before the publication of his novel. 

On the other hand, this dry, oppressive, deadly statistical life in the novel is very robustly resisted by 
both the voice that narrates and the style of narration. The narrator is avowedly not recording the real-life 
situations the novel refers to in an objective way as, throughout the novel, he attacks the system of political 
economy, utilitarianism and self-interest, and invites the reader to form an opinion and take sides. His 
language is loaded with metaphors and compressed and becomes most of the times invasive and rhetorical, 
making polemical and didactic proclamations, as in the excerpt below: 
 

Utilitarian economists, skeletons of schoolmasters, Commissioners of Fact, genteel and used-
up infidels, gabblers of many little dog’s-eared creeds, the poor you will have always with 
you. Cultivate in them, while there is yet time, the utmost graces of the fancies and 
affections, to adorn their lives so much in need of ornament; or, in the day of your triumph, 
when romance is utterly driven out of their souls, and they and a bare existence stand face to 
face, Reality will take a wolfish turn, and make an end of you. 

 
In a paroxysm of rage here, the narrator imagines all preachers of facts being devoured and demolished by 
their own creed which has taken the monstrous shape of a wolf. This grotesque image points towards the very 
characteristic reliance of the narration on genres diametrically opposed to realism, such as the gothic, fairy 
tales or melodrama. The novel abounds in exaggerated characters who bear a close resemblance to ogres, 
witches, fairies, dragons, old women on broomsticks, etc., and have names indicative of their qualities in a 
restoration-comedy fashion (Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. M’Choakumchild grind and choke the imagination of 
innocent children, Mr. Bounderby is a bounder, i.e., a wicked person). To a considerable extent, it also 
borrows from the popular theater, pantomime and circus slapstick in order to reveal the truth to the reader. It is 
through the mouth of the clownish circus owner, the always half-drunk and cross-eyed Mr. Sleary, that the 
ultimate truth is revealed to us in a ludicrous, hardly recognizable, lisp: “People muth be amuthed. […] You 
muth have uth, Thuquire”. The gist of the novel, “people must be amused” as they can’t live without the 
circus, is pronounced in a hilariously amusing way. In its effort to attack factual reality, Dickens’s novel 
sacrifices realism to impossible plot coincidences, incoherent characters, theatricality, artificiality, and 
melodramatic tableaux, and has for this reason been accused by various critics of failing to represent the 
condition of the working people. George Bernard Shaw has characterized Dickens’s depiction of the workers’ 
union leader, for example, “a mere figment of middle-class imagination. No such man would be listened to by 
a meeting of English factory hands” (338).

Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

Yet, despite these departures from the real, Hard Times, is an invaluable portrait of industrialized 
England, the devastating effects of political economy and the predominance of utilitarianism. It is an excellent 
case of how truth does not necessarily lie in the real, a theme that intrigued Henry James, another key figure in 
nineteenth-century literary realism. In his short story “The Real Thing”, published in 1892, James puts 
forward exactly this question of simulation/imitation versus creation of truth in art. The first-person narrator 
and painter in the story finds it impossible to be inspired by the declining but genuinely aristocratic Monarchs, 
or to use them as models for his painting of upper class life. The Monarchs are “the real thing,” the real 
gentleman and the real lady, and, as such, are always trapped in the same thing and can only stand for the 
class of people they belong to. However, “meager little” Miss Churm with her “freckled cockney” and 
“whimsical sensibility” has infinite potential of being metamorphosed into anything the artist wants her. The 
fact that the drawings the painter makes of the Monarchs will always look exactly like them is precisely their 
defect. Miss Churm’s portraits, conversely, can signify everything: “from a fine lady to a shepherdess.” In a 
metafictional flash of frankness, the narrator/painter confesses his perverse, as he calls it, “innate preference 
for the represented subject over the real one: the defect of the real one was so apt to be a lack of 
representation. I liked things that appeared; then one was sure. Whether they were or not was a subordinate 
and almost always a profitless 
question.”  

James’ story provides proof that 
the realists’ pursuit of truth, even their 
trust in the external world, does not 
necessarily mean that their writing is 
reduced to a scrupulous mechanical 
mirroring of material actuality. Like 
modernist writers, realists too are aware 
of the elusiveness of life, the power of 
the imagination and the importance of 
overcoming the subservient attachment 
to trivialities. Most nineteenth-century 
realists acknowledge the shortcomings 
of their means and, as a result, depend 
on their imagination. This fact highlights the continuities rather than the breaches between realism and 
modernism. If realists still believed there was a truth to be told, they knew well that the only way to do that 
was, in Emily Dickinson’s words, to “tell it slant.” 

9. Translucency vs. Polysemy in Language 

What makes circuitous journeys in literature inescapable and perplexes realistic representation even more is 
the fact that the tool of a writer is language. Although it is generally defined as a complex system of signs that 
enables communication, language is often an inadequate method of interaction or even a cause of 
misconceptions. Conceptions of language have changed throughout the centuries, and since the role language 
plays in literature is decisive, it is important to trace the key moments in its trajectory. The English 
philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) formulated his theory of language in his Essay Concerning Human 
Understanding (1690), which prevailed throughout the eighteenth century and set up the basis for consequent 
empirical theories of language. According to Locke, “men came to use spoken words as the signs of their 
ideas” (Book III, Chapter 2, section 1); although these words are selected by people arbitrarily (at that time, 
the word “arbitrarily” meant “dependent on human choice”, not “randomly”), in Locke’s theory, there is a 
great dependence of words on ideas and words are perceived as flat surfaces, transparent glass through which 
we get a sight of the actual world.  
 
 

Emily Dickinson 
 
Tell all the truth but tell it slant — 
Success in Circuit lies 
Too bright for our infirm Delight 
The Truth's superb surprise 
As Lightning to the Children eased 
With explanation kind 
The Truth must dazzle gradually 
Or every man be blind —

Image 3.12 Ferdinard de Saussure, Course in General Linguistics ( 66-67). 

 
This view of language was dominant in the nineteenth century as well, but it was by and large 

contested by twentieth-century structuralist and poststructuralist linguists. The seminal Swiss linguist and 
semiotician Ferdinard de Saussure (1857-1913) challenged the referential function of language and its ability 
to allow entrance to the real world. For Saussure, the sign is the basic unit of meaning and comprises the 
signifier/the word image and the signified/the mental concept. The signified and the signifier are inseparable 
and form a unity. Like Locke, Saussure also believes that the relation between the signifier and the signified is 
arbitrary, i.e. random, but for him, words acquire meaning through their relationship to other words, not 
because they represent things in the actual world. Language, in other words, is a closed system of signs in 
which meaning is produced from the interrelationship between the signs it contains. This is clearly evident in 
contrasting concepts; beauty, for example, cannot be perceived irrespectively of its binary opposite, ugliness, 
in the same way that presence is dependent on our understanding of absence, farness is dependent on 
closeness, right is dependent on wrong, originality on banality, democracy on absolutism, and so on and so 
forth.  

Saussure’s structuralist definition of language as a system of interdependent entities would seem to 
conflict with realist writing which professes to represent an accurate picture of the outside world. And, of 
course, the poststructuralist approaches that followed in the second half of the twentieth century complicated 
things even more. The idea of the unity of the sign, for instance, is rejected by the French controversial 
psychoanalyst and psychiatrist Jacques Lacan (1901-1981), who spoke of the open-endedness of signs. For 
Lacan, the relationship between the signifier and the signified is never a one-to-one relationship, as words can 
never be perceived outside a certain context. Furthermore, we should bear in mind that words are always 
perceived by human beings, and since perception inevitably involves memory, the same signifiers are 
perceived differently by different people. The denotative meaning of a word, even in cases where a word has 
multiple, varied, and/or conflicting definitions, can be traced in a good dictionary. Its connotations, however, 
are countless and depend both on the linguistic context in which the word appears and on the myriad 
associations the word may have for each individual who reads, hears or speaks it.

Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

To have this point further illustrated, let us consider 
the following excerpt from Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park. 
As this passage relies chiefly on the technique of showing 
(i.e. presenting to the reader the characters’ direct words in 
dialogue) and scanty telling, (i.e. narratorial commentary), 
except in the last paragraph, it would be reasonable to 
conclude that this part of the story is presented objectively 
to us through the voice of a non-interfering narrator. A 
company of three, Edmund Bertram, his cousin Fanny 
Price, and their friend, Miss Mary Crawford, have been 
walking around the wood park of a large mansion they are 
visiting and come to rest for a while on a shaded bench. 
Edmund and Mary talk about how exhausted Fanny must 
be, while Mary decides that she must explore further. 
Edmund argues with her about the dimensions of the wood, 
and the two set off to calculate the distance by walking 
about it. Meanwhile, Fanny is persuaded that she should 
stay behind and wait for them. There appears to be nothing 
vulgar or provocative either in the conversation between 
the characters here or in the narrator’s comments at the end, 
and Jane Austen is perhaps the last nineteenth-century 
writer one would consider capable of offensive language. It 
is, however, passages like these in Austen that have 
generated a whole school of criticism delving into her 
bawdy humour and subversive potential, like Eve Kosofsky 
Sedgwick’s “Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl” 
(1991) or Jillian Heydt-Stevenson’s Austen’s Unbecoming 
Conjunctions: Subversive Laughter, Embodied History 
(2005).  

Indeed, if we contemplate the connotative 
meanings of words, like “ha-ha,” for example, and relate 
them to the context of the story and the characters of the 
novel, it becomes clear that in this scene the filter through 
which events are transmitted to us is not really transparent. 
According to the dictionary definition, ha-has are walls or 
other boundary markers set in a ditch so as not to interrupt 
the landscape. It is exactly these rigid borders, i.e., her very 
confined role as a nineteenth-century woman, that unruly 
Mary wants to cross over, and it is only via very suggestive 
references to the geography of the place that this is 
inferred. There’s no direct mention here of Mary’s 
subverting gender stereotypes, claiming the pleasure of a 
female sexual gaze, or experiencing sexual satisfaction; but 
all these lurk around her desire to engross Fanny’s horse, 
look through iron gates, and reach to the bottom of the 
wood right by the side of the ha-ha. In this apparently 
objective recounting of three characters resting on a bench 
and engaged in well-bred conversation, Jane Austen 

actually sabotages all nineteenth-century propriety rules as her heroine wittily and stealthily takes the 
initiative to be in places which immobilized Fanny is prevented from entering. 
 
 
 
 

Structuralism: 
 

A theory that appeared first in the early 
1900s. It stemmed from the structural 

linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure, but 
eventually spread over to a large range of 

disciplines, like sociology, psychology, 
anthropology, literary criticism, 

architecture, and economics. According to 
structuralism, human life phenomena 

make sense only through their 
interrelations which constitute a large 

structure. The aim of a structuralist is to 
examine these substantial underlying 

structures that motivate human activity. 
The term appeared in the works of the 

French anthropologist Claude Lévi-
Strauss, writers such as Louis Althusser 
and the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. In 

the 1960s, most of the principles of 
structuralism were brushed aside by a 

number of French theorists called 
poststructuralists, like the historian 

Michel Foucault, the philosopher and 
social commentator Jacques Derrida, the 
Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, the 

literary critic Roland Barthes, and the 
feminist theorists Julia Kristeva and Luce 

Irigaray.  
 

Poststructuralism: 
  

This movement criticized basically the 
idea that there is a clear-cut overarching 

structure lying beneath texts. The real 
structure or the truth for 

poststructuralists is not embedded in 
texts, but produced through 

interpretation and therefore is always in 
the process of being disputed. Texts, in 

other words, do not have single or 
monolithic meanings, but are open to 

multifaceted and often conflicting 
readings which are in direct correlation 

with the background of each reader.

Jane Austen, Mansfield Park 
Chapter IX 

 
A few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the very walk they had been talking of; 

and standing back, well shaded and sheltered, and looking over a ha-ha into the park, was a 
comfortable-sized bench, on which they all sat down.  

“I am afraid you are very tired, Fanny,” said Edmund, observing her; “why would not you 
speak sooner? This will be a bad day's amusement for you if you are to be knocked up. Every sort 
of exercise fatigues her so soon, Miss Crawford, except riding.”  

“How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as I did all last week! I am 
ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happen again.”  

“Your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect. Fanny's 
interest seems in safer hands with you than with me.”  

“That she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise; for there is nothing in the 
course of one's duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning: seeing a great house, 
dawdling from one room to another, straining one’s eyes and one's attention, hearing what one does 
not understand, admiring what one does not care for. It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore 
in the world, and Miss Price has found it so, though she did not know it.” 

“I shall soon be rested,” said Fanny; “to sit in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure, 
is the most perfect refreshment.” 

After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again. “I must move,” said she; “resting 
fatigues me. I have looked across the ha-ha till I am weary. I must go and look through that iron 
gate at the same view, without being able to see it so well.” 

Edmund left the seat likewise. “Now, Miss Crawford, if you will look up the walk, you will 
convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long, or half half a mile.” 

“It is an immense distance,” said she; “I see that with a glance.” 
He still reasoned with her, but in vain. She would not calculate, she would not compare. She 

would only smile and assert. The greatest degree of rational consistency could not have been more 
engaging, and they talked with mutual satisfaction. At last it was agreed that they should endeavour 
to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a little more about it. They would go to one 
end of it, in the line they were then in—for there was a straight green walk along the bottom by the 
side of the ha-ha—and perhaps turn a little way in some other direction, if it seemed likely to assist 
them, and be back in a few minutes. Fanny said she was rested, and would have moved too, but this 
was not suffered. Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could 
not resist, and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin's care, but with great 
regret that she was not stronger. She watched them till they had turned the corner, and listened till 
all sound of them had ceased. 

10. The Dialogic Character of the Novel  

10.1 Centripetal vs. Centrifugal Forces 

Twentieth-century theories of language, as we have already seen, have enabled fresh readings of nineteenth 
century texts which, under the scope of the early twentieth-century modernist experimentation, had been 
devalued as static and monolithic. The most influential theory, however, which put forward a new 
understanding of the novel and instigated groundbreaking reconceptualizations of the genre was formulated by 
the Russian formalist theorist and critic of literature Mikhail Bakhtin (1895-1975).  

According to Bakhtin, the principal characteristic of language is heteroglossia, the fact that language 
at all times consists of multiple layers which correspond not only to linguistic dialects, but also to socio-
ideological languages related with factors like age, social groups, professions, gender, class, etc. “All words,” 

140 
 



Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

Bakhtin writes, “have the ‘taste’ of a profession, a genre, a tendency, party, a particular work, a particular 
person, a generation, an age group, the day and hour,” and no word can escape its contextual overtones which 
can be “generic, tendentious, individualistic” (293). Words can never simply reflect objects, but are always 
engaged in an interactive and antagonistic dialogue with them. In languages that are alive and developing, 
words travel towards objects. In doing so, they come upon other “alien” words that are already there in the 
objects and with which they intersect in order to create new meanings (Bakhtin 279). As a result, each 
word/voice speaks of its own way of seeing the world and from its own value system. 

This is what makes Bakhtin reject definitions of language as a common unitary system of linguistic 
norms that lay emphasis on what he calls the centripetal forces of language. These forces aim at conquering 
variety in language and promoting a “concrete verbal and ideological unification and centralization, which 
develop in vital connection with the processes of sociopolitical and cultural centralization” (Bakhtin 271). 
Along with these centripetal forces, though, operate centrifugal forces that counteract unification and 
centralization striving for disunification and decentralization (Bakhtin 272). Consequently, every utterance is 
inherently heteroglot (many-voiced), since it embodies contradictory voices, and dialogic, as these voices are 
involved in an incessant conflict. Meaning, for Bakhtin, can be produced only by the word’s interaction with 
other words in certain contexts.  
 

Michael Bakhtin, The Dialogic Imagination 
 
At the time when major divisions of the poetic genres were developing under the influence of the 
unifying, centralizing, centripetal forces of verbal-ideological life, the novel—and those artistic-
prose genres that gravitate toward it—was being historically shaped by the current of 
decentralizing, centrifugal forces. At the time when poetry was accomplishing the task of cultural, 
national and political centralization of the verbal-ideological world in the higher official socio-
ideological levels, on the lower levels, on the stages of local fairs and the buffoon spectacle, the 
heteroglossia of the clown sounded forth, ridiculing all “languages” and dialects; there developed 
the literature of the fabliaux and Schwänke of street songs, anecdotes, where there was no 
language-center at all, where there was to be found a lively play with the “languages” of poets, 
scholars, monks, knights and others, where all “languages” were masks and where no language 
could claim to be an authentic, incontestable face. (272-73) 

 
What is crucial in our discussion here is Bakhtin’s perception of the novel as a dialogic genre par 

excellence. Novels are distinct from other literary genres, he argues; unlike epics, which endeavor to abolish 
diversity, novels embrace diversity. They are by nature polyphonic, artistic orchestrations of multiple voices, 
as prose writers can distance themselves from the language of their own work and celebrate multivocality. 
Unlike the epic poet, the novelist has no fear of the unfamiliar meanings and tones of words and therefore 
feels no urge to eliminate them. Novelists, Bakhtin writes, do not “speak in a given language,” they speak 
“through language,” like a ventriloquist that can juggle diverse voices and trick you about their source. This 
polyphonic quality of novels can function at a number of levels. In a more elemental way, it may refer to the 
different voices of the characters in the novel, their different dialects, sociolects or idiolects. In a more 
complex way, it may have to do with the variety of genres from which a novel is borrowing or the variety of 
points of view filtered through the voice of the narrator(s).  

10.2 The Novel as a Hybrid Genre  

Let us consider first the polyphonic aspect of the novel as far as genre is concerned. Bakhtin perceives the 
novel as an all-enveloping and ever-developing genre, unique in its capacity to ingest and devour other genres 
while still maintaining its status as a novel. Its idiosyncratic structure can embrace, parody, and reformulate or 
“novelize” other genres (like drama, see for ex. Ibsen or naturalist drama), epic poetry (for ex. Byron’s Don 
Juan), or lyric poetry (Heine’s lyrical verse). The novel questions the fixed characteristics of well established 
genres, he argues, blends them with innovative elements, and achieves a wider and deeper perspective of ever-

141 
 



Katerina Kitsi-Mitakou 
 

changing, ever-unfolding reality. Heroes from medieval romances, for example, as has already been 
mentioned above, are metamorphosed into anti-heroic parodies in the novel. They are no longer one-sided but 
acquire new dimensions as their positive qualities are depicted along with the ridiculous, base and flawed 
aspects of their character. They make mistakes and learn from them, or refuse to learn, but in either case 
reveal to the reader a broader and more complexly rich view of life. It is in the nature of the novel to rely on 
other forms and at the same time expose their conventionality, reappropriate them, and in doing so enable 
fresh understandings of the world.  

Bakhtin’s theory can prove to be very enlightening when exploring the British nineteenth-century 
novel, as its attachment to realism is mostly characterized by haziness and uncertainty especially when 
compared with the French nineteenth-century novel. Although both French and English novels of the time 
share the tendency to position characters and events in a real historical moment and direct their gaze towards 
the low and up-to-that-time neglected part of life, English realism is far more indirect and complicated, as the 
influential literary critic George Levine has shown. This is largely due to the fact that most major novelists of 
that century are still under the insistent influence of romanticism. Enlightenment thought with its trust in 
rational scientific knowledge has left an indelible mark on the eighteenth-century novel, but in the nineteenth 
century such models of perception are always pervaded by a Romantic critique of utilitarian thinking. This has 
been made clear in the previous reference to Dickens’s Hard Times, an industrial novel which assembles 
elements from melodrama, fairy tales or the gothic and presents the distilled truth through the voice of a 
clown. But the strong link to romanticism is evident in a whole range of authors affiliated with realism, like 
Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, the Brontës, George Eliot and Thomas Hardy. Jane Austen’s Pride and 
Prejudice is a realistic depiction of early-nineteenth-century society with residues of the archaic romance; 
Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre combines the domestic-realist governess fiction with elements from the Gothic 
and the romance; Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights relies heavily on the uncanny and Gothic romance; 
George Eliot’s Middlemarch anticipates the modern psychological novel; Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the 
d’Urbervilles blends realism with symbolism. The list is endless. 

10.3 Point of View 

It is not only genre that British nineteenth-century realism transforms, but narrative techniques as well. 
Although realism is dedicated, as we said, to representing social realities in an objective way, it is not ignorant 
of the fact that these realities are intricate and constructed. Consequently, the voice that narrates is in many 
cases split or unstable, and omniscience is recognized as an impossible task. Even the highly anti-romantic 
William Thackeray, a chief representative of the realist school, distrusts omniscient narrators and 
acknowledges their deficiencies. In his not so very well-known novel The Newcomes, which is an education in 
the Victorian era with its hundreds of references to Victorian poets, painters, politicians and events of the 
time, the narrator openly declares his inability to comprehend the minds of his characters and reach the depths 
of their hearts. There are, of course, other, more subtle, narrators who rather than reveal their intentions to the 
readers delight in carrying them off track. This is usually the case with Jane Austen’s ventriloquist narrators 
whose voice often mixes with the voice of the characters. We are often tricked into believing that the views 
which the narrator expresses are the views of an external non-involved observer, but Austen’s narrators 
recurrently adopt the perspective of certain characters in the novel without warning us. This kind of stylistic 
contagion (i.e., a case in which the way the narrator thinks is infected by the way a character thinks), or literal 
endosmosis (i.e., the two voices are like two liquids separated by a thin membrane which eventually breaks 
and allows them to merge), as it has also been called, is a precursor of the phenomenon of Free Indirect 
Speech encountered in modernist fiction par excellence.  

Such a renowned “lie,” or case of Free Indirect Speech, can be traced in the opening sentence of Pride 
and Prejudice, which is presented to us as a universal truth supposedly announced by the narrator: “It is a 
truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.” 
The lack of inverted commas here, which would mark the beginning and end of someone else’s quoted words, 
makes us infer that this statement is expressed and supported by the narrator. Οnly when the readers get to the 
second paragraph, do they realize that what has been advertised as a world-widely accepted truth is actually 
the very limited perspective of certain people who live in a certain neighbourhood:  
 

142 
 



Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a 
neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is 
considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. 

 
Furthermore, the narrator very subtly draws together the word “truth” and the idea of fixity, a fact 

which would make any cautious reader suspect that this truth is nothing but an obsession. As a result, this 
initially “universal truth” is eventually reduced to an absurd fixation, especially when it is explained as the 

conviction that newcomers are deemed “the rightful 
property” of the unmarried female population. Its 
universality shrinks to an astonishing degree when in the 
rest of Chapter One, through the dialogue between Mr. and 
Mrs. Bennet, we are led to conclude that this preposterous 
thought is stuck in Mrs. Bennet’s mind, the mother of five 
girls, who is in desperate need of finding husbands for 
them. This chapter ends with the narrator’s very caustic 
remarks about Mrs. Bennet: “She was a woman of mean 
understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. 
[…] The business of her life was to get her daughters 
married; its solace was visiting and news”. Such sarcasm 
reasonably makes one wonder why the narrator would 
adopt her prejudiced perspective in the very first sentence 
of the book.  

The answer lies in the fact that for Austen, as for 
most British realist writers, truth is more complex than it 
appears to be. Her narrator’s voice is in a sense undecided, 
as while it is rooted in the world it describes (the landed 
gentry of early nineteenth-century England), it 
simultaneously undermines it through refined criticism and 

irony. It is not accidental that Free Indirect Speech, a narrative device which was adopted systematically by 
modernist writers in the early twentieth century, was first used consistently by Jane Austen in the early 
nineteenth century. Both Austen and modernist writers, in different ways and degrees of course, distrusted 
universal truths and perceived reality as flux rather than rigidity and permanence. Hence, their preference for 
polyphony and the joining together of incompatible points of view.  

11. Female Realism 

Austen’s revisiting of “universal truths” is largely due to the fact that these truths nailed women down to very 
limited roles. Her contribution to the novel is unique not only because it exploits the potential of narrative 
voice and anticipates modernism, but, more importantly perhaps, because it establishes a female form of 
realism. In the same way, antiheroes and the lower strata of society permeated fiction in the eighteenth 
century, as we have seen, women gained momentum in nineteenth-century novels. This is not to suggest that 
female characters were not there before, but for the first time women are represented by women and given a 
voice of their own. Let us not forget that women were the major consumers and producers of fiction in the 
nineteenth century. Inspired by her predecessor, Frances Burney (1752-1840), a writer who concentrated on 
representing women’s social lives and struggles in a patriarchal world, Austen launches a tradition of novels 
by women about women which was carried on throughout the century by writers like the Brontës, Elizabeth 
Gaskell, and George Eliot.  

For all these female writers, reality had up to that point been defined by male voices and was therefore 
partial and prejudiced. Women had been misrepresented as weak, feeble and inconstant creatures locked in 
feminine domestic sensibility. “Men have had the advantage of us in telling their own story,” Anne Elliot 
protests gently in Austen’s last novel, Persuasion. “Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the 
pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything,” Anne concludes. In the novels of these 
nineteenth-century female writers, women are able to reason, express their views and take an active stance, 
while their domestic concerns and affairs are recognized as an essential part of everyday reality. With these 

Free Indirect Speech/Discourse/Style: 
 

This literary term refers to what Bakhtin 
calls “double-voiced discourse,” i.e. the 

confusion of two voices, usually that of the 
narrator and that of a character. In such 

narrative passages, the third-person 
narration is overrun by the style of a 

character’s language (this can be evident 
in the tone of voice, vocabulary, thoughts, 
values or perspectives of the character) 

without the external indication of inverted 
commas. Although this style of writing 

was first used consistently by Jane Austen, 
it is extensively adopted by modernist 

writers.

women writers, the novel acquires a new dimension, as it acknowledges domesticity as a central part of 
reality. Their witty, competent, passionate, persistent, independent, strong-minded, or educated female 
protagonists enable fresh insights into the world, life and history. While public or major historical events are 
either only indirectly alluded to or presented through the prism of female protagonists, concerns originally 
considered private (like marriage, love, parenting, housekeeping) come to the forefront and obtain political 
importance.  

If we return for a moment to the example from Pride and Prejudice mentioned in the previous section, 
we can see how cautiously, almost imperceptibly, Austen engrafts on the novel the point of view of women, 
even silly and frivolous women like Mrs. Bennet. According to common sense and plot evidence, it is 
gentlemen or ladies in need (not in possession) of a fortune that are in want of a wife or a husband. It is indeed 
Mr. Wickham, Charlotte Lucas, and all the potentially impoverished Bennet girls who must desperately hit 
upon a good match in order to escape disgrace or misery. Yet there is truth in this introductory sentence when 
set within the early nineteenth-century context and seen through the prism of the social hierarchies of the time. 
A well-off gentleman belonging to the landed gentry, like Mr. Darcy, was indeed in need of a wife, if he were 
to set a proper example to the large parish he was in charge of and rule as a proper proprietor. It is his future 
wife, Elizabeth Bennet, who provides Mr. Darcy with the opportunity to be aware of his pride and reform his 
behaviour. Although the initial remark in Chapter One of the book conflates with the perspective of 
unintelligent and unwise Mrs. Bennet, it is not entirely discarded in Pride and Prejudice. Truth with Austen 
seems to broaden its spectrum in order to accommodate points of view that had up to that time been 
considered trifling and superfluous. So, a propertied gentleman like Mr. Darcy, the novel concludes, can 
accomplish his public mission successfully only if his private life is illuminated and enriched by a proper 
heroine like Elizabeth. Although she is silly Mrs. Bennet’s daughter, Elizabeth is well aware that her mother’s 
frivolous perspective alludes to the actual dangers that women of her class would have to face if not married 
to an eligible gentleman, and encapsulates traces of a “universal truth,” according to which women are a 
crucial and indispensible part of society.  

12. Realism: Reactionary or Progressive? 

We have argued so far that realism began as a genre that was affiliated with the rising middle class and 
focused on characters and aspects of life that had long been unrepresented or of minor significance in art and 
literature. The antiheroic voices of pedantic characters, or the uncouth lower classes, or even the 
unsophisticated female population that invaded eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature gave to it an air 
of democratization. Seen through the prism of modernism, however, in the first decades of the twentieth 
century, realism became synonymous with conservatism. At a time when almost all religious, philosophical 
and scientific dogmas were put into question, the lens of realism was too narrow and restrictive. For modernist 
writers and thinkers, realism, with its attachment to positivist thinking, was considered incapable of 
transferring the depth, complexity and confusion of modern experience.  

During the interwar period especially, a group of German theorists, who were later labeled “The 
Frankfurt School,” began to consider Enlightenment and positivism as a form of dictatorship. For the 
sociologist/philosophers Theodor Adorno (1903-1969) or Max Horkheimer (1895-1973) for instance, 
bourgeois Enlightenment imposed a very limited and biased perspective that aimed at naturalizing and 
reinforcing the prevalent state of things. Consequently, realism’s trust in Enlightenment and rational thinking 
rendered it a conformist and reactionary mode. In a similar way, a number of critics in the second half of the 
twentieth-century accused realism of representing a simplified one-dimensional view of the world. According 
to the French literary theorist Roland Barthes (1915-1980), the world we encounter in realist fiction is “purged 
of the uncertainty of existence,” and the realist mode is too absorbed in documenting reality and too lost in 
concrete details (Writing Degree Zero 27). In Critical Practice (1980), a very influential and innovative book 
on the theory and practice of criticism, the British literary critic Catherine Belsey (1940-) also speaks of 
realism as a transparent medium that endorses the dominant status quo. In classic realism, Belsey contends, 
“The reader is invited to perceive and judge the ‘truth’ of the text, the coherent, non-contradictory 
interpretation of the world” (69).

Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

Roland Barthes, from “The Reality Effect” 
 
Resistance of the “real” (in its written form of course) to structure is very limited in the fictive 
account, constructed by definition on a model which, for its main outlines, has no other constraints 
than those of intelligibility; but this same “reality” becomes the essential reference in historical 
narrative, which is supposed to report “what really happened”: what does the non-functionality of a 
detail matter then, once it denotes “what took place”; “concrete reality” becomes the sufficient 
justification for speaking. History (historical discourse: historia rerum gestarum) is in fact the 
model of those narratives which consent to fill in the interstices of their functions by structurally 
superfluous notations, and it is logical that literary realism should have been—give or take a few 
decades—contemporary with the regnum of objective history, to which must be added the 
contemporary development of techniques, of works, and institutions based on the incessant need to 
authenticate the “real”: the photograph (immediate witness of “what was there”), reportage, 
exhibitions of ancient objects (the success of the Tutankhamen show makes this quite clear), the 
tourism of monuments and historical sites. 
 All this shows that the “real” is supposed to be self-sufficient, that is strong enough to belie any 
notion of “function” […]. (146-47) 

 
Realism has also been attacked by postcolonial critics like Edward Said (1935-2003) or Gayatri 

Spivak (1942-) as a genre that promotes the imperialist project and is complicit with the dominant 
Eurocentrism of the nineteenth century. For them, the nineteenth-century novel reflects the notion that 
Europeans as a superior people undertook the noble task of civilizing what they thought of as inferior nations 
or races. In Culture and Imperialism (1993), a seminal work in postcolonial criticism, Said draws examples 
from mainstream eighteen-century, Victorian, and twentieth-century writers to argue that in the British novel, 
“the right to colonial possessions helps directly to establish social order and moral priorities at home” (73). In 
works by Defoe, Austen, Dickens, Thackeray, the Brontës, Conrad, Kipling, etc., colonial territories are in the 
centre or background of their plots either as sources of wealth or as repository of unwanted characters. 
Moreover, the colonial “other” is always a grotesque threat to social order, a fantastic monstrous impossibility 
which realist characters are challenged to confront and expel.  

More specifically, Said invites us to consider a number of such cases in which the colonies are 
exploited both literally (the English invest on their affluent natural resources) and metaphorically (the English 
build their pre-eminence on the alleged inferiority of the natives). Said examines a number of examples drawn 
from the huge tank of the nineteenth-century novel. Abel Magwitch, for instance, from Dickens’s Great 
Expectations, is an ex-convict deported to Australia, who eventually becomes a colonial businessman, but is 
denied return to England although he finances Pip’s dream of developing into a successful English gentleman. 
Bertha Mason, Mr. Rochester’s deranged West Indian wife in Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, is exiled in an 
attic and censored for ever when burned alive, allowing Mr. Rochester to marry Jane, a sound English 
educator. The authoritative and powerful Sir Thomas Bertram in Austen’s Mansfireld Park has made a fortune 
as a plantation and slave owner in Antigua, a fact which, Said argues, is conveniently silenced in the novel. 
And it is precisely realist representation, the critics of realism maintain, that mutes marginal and oppressed 
voices; if the genre of realism has promised the readers to convey the material and objective aspect of a 
certain historical time, then realism, they conclude, is committed to promoting the prevailing conventionalized 
modes of thinking and establishing a stereotypical image of society as recognizable and predictable. 
 

Edward Said, from Culture and Imperialism 
 
As a reference, as a point of definition, as an easily assumed place of travel, wealth, and service, 
the empire functions for much of the European nineteenth century as a codified, if only marginally 
visible, presence in fiction, very much like the servants in grand households and in novels, whose 

145 
 



Katerina Kitsi-Mitakou 
 

work is taken for granted but scarcely ever more than named, rarely studied […], or given density. 
To cite another intriguing analogue, imperial possessions are as usefully there, anonymous and 
collective, as the outcast populations […] of transient workers, part-time employees, seasonal 
artisans; their existence always counts, though their names and identities do not, they are 
profitable without being fully there. […] [They are] people on whom the economy and polity 
sustained by empire depend, but whose reality has not historically or culturally required attention. 
In all of these instances the facts of empire are associated with sustained possession, with far-
flung and sometimes unknown spaces, with eccentric or unacceptable human beings, with fortune-
enhancing or fantasized activities like emigration, money-making, and sexual adventure. 
Disgraced younger sons are sent off to the colonies, shabby older relatives go there to try to 
recoup lost fortunes […], enterprising young travellers go there to sow wild oats and to collect 
exotica. The colonial territories are realms of possibility, and they have always been associated 
with the realistic novel. Robinson Crusoe is virtually unthinkable without the colonizing mission 
that permits him to create a new world of his own in the distant reaches of the African, Pacific, 
and Atlantic wilderness. (75) 

 
This, however, is an evaluation which fails to consider realism in all its dimensions. As we have seen 

in our analysis so far, realism does not turn a deaf ear to the weak and feeble (whether this involves categories 
like gender, class or race), nor does it favor monolithic readings. Modern insights of theory and criticism have 
allowed us to appreciate realist texts in all their complexity and throw light on the inconsistencies, ellipses, or 
subversions that are embedded in realist fiction. As Said himself plainly states in Culture and Imperialism, we 
must read “the great canonical texts, and perhaps also the entire archive of modern and pre-modern European 
and American culture, with an effort to draw out, extend, give emphasis and voice to what is silent or 
marginally present or ideologically represented (I have in mind Kipling’s Indian characters) in such works” 
(78). In the past few decades, such readings have indeed been attempted and have enabled readers to gain a 
clearer picture of realism’s experimental and dissident moments. Contemporary criticism in most cases 
focuses on examining how conflicting tendencies or centripetal and centrifugal forces in texts are engaged in a 
dialectic relationship rather than conflating realism with ideological and aesthetic conservatism. It is without 
doubt that the insistence of realism on precision or detail does not function as a means of sedating the readers 
and robbing them of their power to think and resist. In most realist fiction, despite the overriding references to 
an external materiality, the status quo is often questioned and the texts inspire an active reaction to social 
injustice, inequalities and wrongs.  

If we return for a moment to the examples from Said’s book mentioned above, it becomes evident that 
when read in the context of the whole novel in which they appear, they constitute more complicated cases and 
not an unambiguous support of Eurocentrism, Englishness, or patriarchy. New South Wales, for instance, is 
only a vague background in Dickens’s story, but it has given Abel Magwitch the chance to reform himself 
and, most importantly, to support Pip’s great expectations. The half-Creole Bertha Mason is of course a 
threatening “Other” in Brontë’s novel; it is Bertha, however, who enables Jane to see the true face of Mr. 
Rochester and motivates her to assume a dynamic role in their relationship. The Bertrams may be apathetic to 
where their riches and status derive from, but the reference to the Antigua plantation is a clear allusion to 
slavery and Sir Thomas’ despotic character is not condoned in the novel. Even if most nineteenth-century 
novels offer an orderly ending that complies with the orthodox notions of gender, class or race at that time, 
more often than not these texts question them in explicit, implicit, and, quite often, unorthodox ways.  

One such striking case of an avant-garde ending can be traced in Eliot’s The Mill on the Floss. Maggie 
Tulliver’s death by drowning seems to be a just and suitable finale to the story of an unruly woman, “a 
mistake of nature,” as perceived by most of the characters around her. Maggie’s behaviour defies stereotypical 
definitions of women, especially as these were prescribed by the dominant Darwinian pattern of the mid-
nineteenth century: she is more intelligent than her brother, “perversely” attracted by the frail and sick Phillip 
Wakem, and too energetic to tame her passion for life. It is to be expected that Maggie must be discarded as 
an irregularity; her tragic death, however, signifies simultaneously her release from the confining pattern of 
marriage and reproduction. Water functions as a modernist symbol of cleansing and liberation in the novel and 
seems to be the natural element for amphibious creatures like Maggie. In this autobiographical novel, Maggie 
reflects her creator’s dual nature (George Eliot was the pseudonym of Marian Evans, who adopted a male 

146 
 



Realisms: The British Novel in the Nineteenth-Century 
 

identity in order to publish her works), and like Marian Evans she seeks a place/element/space in which 
women are given the freedom to be creative and express themselves. The overflowing of the river comes as a 
blessing to Maggie who surrenders to its power without any agony at all. The “angry” river is, after all, an 
echo of the angry voice of a woman deprived of freedom. It is only when “the threads of ordinary association” 
are broken, when Maggie loses consciousness and enters this dreamlike unconscious state in which the past 
merges with the present that she finds relief. Although Eliot, as we have seen, is the most ardent representative 
of realism in Britain, her ending here anticipates the modernist tendency to perceive time as circular rather 
than linear, the modernist fascination with the dark unexplored aspects of the human mind, as well as the split 
self which invades modernist fiction.  
 

George Eliot, The Mill on the Floss 
 

Book Seventh, Chapter V 
The Last Conflict 

 
At that moment Maggie felt a startling sensation of sudden cold about her knees and feet; it was 
water flowing under her. She started up; the stream was flowing under the door that led into the 
passage. She was not bewildered for an instant; she knew it was the flood! 
………………………………………………………………………………………………………… 

And without a moment's shudder of fear, she plunged through the water, which was rising 
fast to her knees, and by the glimmering light of the candle she had left on the stairs, she mounted 
on to the window-sill, and crept into the boat, which was left with the prow lodging and protruding 
through the window.  
………………………………………………………………………………………………………… 

In the first moments Maggie felt nothing, thought of nothing, but that she had suddenly 
passed away from that life which she had been dreading; it was the transition of death, without its 
agony,–and she was alone in the darkness with God. 

The whole thing had been so rapid, so dreamlike, that the threads of ordinary association 
were broken; she sank down on the seat clutching the oar mechanically, and for a long while had no 
distinct conception of her position. The first thing that waked her to fuller consciousness was the 
cessation of the rain, and a perception that the darkness was divided by the faintest light, which 
parted the overhanging gloom from the immeasurable watery level below. She was driven out upon 
the flood,–that awful visitation of God which her father used to talk of; which had made the 
nightmare of her childish dreams. And with that thought there rushed in the vision of the old home, 
and Tom, and her mother,–they had all listened together. 
………………………………………………………………………………………………………… 

Oh, how welcome, the widening of that dismal watery level, the gradual uplifting of the 
cloudy firmament, the slowly defining blackness of objects above the glassy dark! Yes, she must be 
out on the fields; those were the tops of hedgerow trees. Which way did the river lie? Looking 
behind her, she saw the lines of black trees; looking before her, there were none; then the river lay 
before her. She seized an oar and began to paddle the boat forward with the energy of wakening 
hope; the dawning seemed to advance more swiftly, now she was in action; and she could soon see 
the poor dumb beasts crowding piteously on a mound where they had taken refuge. Onward she 
paddled and rowed by turns in the growing twilight; her wet clothes clung round her, and her 
streaming hair was dashed about by the wind, but she was hardly conscious of any bodily 
sensations,–except a sensation of strength, inspired by mighty emotion. Along with the sense of 
danger and possible rescue for those long-remembered beings at the old home, there was an 
undefined sense of reconcilement with her brother; what quarrel, what harshness, what unbelief in 
each other can subsist in the presence of a great calamity, when all the artificial vesture of our life 
is gone, and we are all one with each other in primitive mortal needs? Vaguely Maggie felt this, in 
the strong resurgent love toward her brother that swept away all the later impressions of hard, cruel

offence and misunderstanding, and left only the deep, underlying, unshakable memories of early 
union. 

13. Conclusion  

Eliot’s projection into the future makes us realize that borders and definitions are there to be contested and 
broken. Let us remember that, although we traced the origins of realism as a movement in art and literature in 
the mid-nineteenth century, we have seen how this mode of representation was born long before that when the 
new middle class was beginning to gain power in Europe. Or, that although we identified the main 
characteristics of the genre to be linear plots, real-life characters, and the portrayal of low life, it has become 
obvious that this is not always the case. And, that although we defined the novel by contrasting it to the 
medieval romance, there are major realist texts that either borrow from the romance (or from a variety of other 
genres, like the Gothic, the grotesque or melodrama), or anticipate modernist techniques. We are closer to 
understanding realism if we perceive it as inherently dialogic and inevitably connected with what preceded or 
followed it. Like the novel, with which realism is closely affiliated, this mode of representation is also a 
hybrid: both an unattainable utopia and an omnipresent possibility. On the one hand, it is an impossibility, as a 
hundred percent objective representation of life is a ridiculous claim, since in art and literature there will 
always be a filter through which reality or a slice of it is transferred to the reader. On the other hand, it is a 
genre that permeates all writing, as it would be absurd to assert that there are works of art that have no 
connection to the real world. Eliot’s nineteenth-century image of the “defective mirror” has made it clear that 
realism is not a transparent genre that excludes the possibility of a critical stance towards the reality it depicts. 
In order to do justice to it, it would be more productive to approach realism as an inconstant and polysemous 
form of expression and explore it in all its diversity.

Chapter Four 

Modernist and Postmodernist Fiction(s) 
Effie Yiannopoulou 

1. Introduction: Terms and aims 

The large body of critical work centred on modernism and postmodernism, which has seen the light of day in 
the twentieth century and the first years of the twentieth first, is simply impressive. What partly accounts for 
such extensive and ever proliferating critical responses to the two (cultural and aesthetic) movements may be 
connected, on one level at least, to the lack of consensus and the intense debate carried out among 
commentators with regard to their meaning and politics. As terms, modernism and postmodernism have 
infiltrated the professional idioms of a variety of disciplinary fields, from literature, art and philosophy to 
architecture, film and cultural analysis. They are, however, often interpreted multiply in their various contexts, 
decoded as they are in ways that address very specific, field-bound issues and problems. What is more, their 
definitional limits are further stretched by the ongoing revision to which they have been subjected since at 
least the 1970s, as new theoretical concerns come to bear on already established positions. For example, the 
recent interest in postcolonial studies and globalization has come to question modernism’s cultural politics, 
especially its Eurocentric focus, by uncovering forms of non-Western art and literature that compete with 
James Joyce in their groundbreaking aesthetic innovations (Said; Moore-Gilbert; Cuddy-Keane). In like 
manner, postmodernism’s encounter with feminism or the anxieties emanating from the new planetary order 
since 9/11 has refueled the debate regarding its politics. Is postmodernism the result and perpetrator of 
contemporary capitalist, consumerist, largely Western practices or a critical formation capable of reacting to 
their inbuilt injustices? Ιs it even worth posing these questions at this moment in history when, as a word and 
idea, postmodernism is considered (by some) passé and out of fashion? What might be fairly safely argued at 
this point is that there is no one single answer to these questions. Over the years, modernism and 
postmodernism have opened themselves up to multiple, often competing, mutually interrogating 
interpretations and evaluations, proving slippery and contentious as organizing categories and prompting 
commentators in the field to speak of “modernisms” and “postmodernisms” in the plural. This is certainly a 
gesture meant to register the diversity of positions that have been brought together under the names of the 
modern and the postmodern. At the same time, it also crucially underlines the extent to which non-uniformity, 
self-contradiction and lack of self-identity (one single and fixed identity) are central to what modernists and 
postmodernists do and the alternative representations of reality and the world that they offer.  

In line with this view, in this chapter I will not provide all-encompassing definitions or a full account 
of the various modernisms and postmodernisms one is likely to encounter. I will offer, instead, a brief and 
selective introduction into their basic assumptions and aesthetic practices and suggest ways in which you can 
begin to orient yourselves in these ever-shifting spaces mostly by working my way through specific examples. 
My focus will be on literary (primarily fictional), artistic and cultural texts, with the odd theoretical essay 
thrown in, and will pay special emphasis on their relationship to notions of the real, the subject and the 
political (the texts’ own ideological positions and engagement with the world we live in). Brief detours into 
the historical, cultural and intellectual forces that have framed and shaped literary and artistic production since 
the late nineteenth century will be carried out when necessary. Finally, I shall suggest reading paths which you 
can follow to reach more extensive analyses of the issues broached in this chapter. 

In the discussion that follows, there are at least four cognate terms that rub shoulders and which this 
essay will spend time unpacking: modernity, modernism, postmodernity, postmodernism. How do they relate 
to each other? Do they share conceptual links, as their common etymological root suggests, or are they 
defined by a relationship of confrontation and mutually-launched challenges? Or both? And why do we need 
to know? As a starting point, it is worth noting that both “modernity” and “postmodernity” are frequently 
understood as terms that designate social, cultural and intellectual conditions, while “modernism” and 
“postmodernism” aesthetic phenomena.

2. Modernity 

To understand where modernist and postmodernist attempts at disturbing modes of representation emerge 
from, what they are reacting against and what aesthetic and ideological complexities they ultimately expose, it 
is vital to have some sense of the philosophical, political and cultural discourses that make up “modernity.” 
Modernity is at best a slippery term. It was first used by Charles Baudelaire in his essay “The Painter of 
Modern Life” (1863) to describe “the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent” quality of modern living (13). It 
captures the sense of rapid and continual change that shape human life in the industrialized urban centres of 
the nineteenth century where novel technologies accelerate the speed of living and revise our notions of time 
and space. In fact, to be modern is to be confronted with the new in all fields of human activity, from science 
and philosophy to communication and travel. Modernity is a time of constant transformation that affects the 
human being’s self perception and relationship to nature and knowledge, leading to a distinctly modern 
conceptualization of the individual and the real (how we see the world around us). Locating its beginnings has 
proved notoriously difficult. There are critics who consider the eighteenth century and its revolutionary 
activity the founding moment of the modern. For many, however, modern times begin with the Renaissance, 
at the end of the Middle Ages, and find a culminating point in the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment 
(For more on the divisions of modernity see Berman). Would this mean, though, that there never was an age 
of transformation before the advent of the modern? Not quite. What characterizes modernity is not simply 
more change but a different stance towards the very idea of “change” which is now reappraised and taken to 
act, in the context of a highly valued rationalism, as the measure of what is human and civilised. Michel 
Foucault, the French historian and philosopher, rightly suggests that we think of modernity as an “attitude,” “a 
way of thinking and feeling,” and also a way of “acting and behaving,” rather than a historical period (39). 
Re-conceptualizing the modern as an attitude, rather than only an époque, opens the way for recognizing its 

153

continuing impact on the present, and accepting that it lives on alongside and within postmodernity rather than 
lie buried safely in a past that no longer concerns us. In this line of thinking, the modern continues to shape 
how we relate to contemporary reality and how we think about both individual and collective identities 
(subjects and communities). It also explains the reason why modernist and postmodernist authors and artists 
have engaged with the beliefs and conflicts of the modern with such force and persistence—either to produce 
radical critiques of its foundational premises or to suggest “counter-modernities” as postcolonial critics Homi 
Bhabha and Paul Gilroy have both done.  

2.1 Modernity’s Main Features: An Example 

I will now turn to Roland Barthes’s essay “The Eiffel Tower” to unpack further the meanings implicit in 
modernity’s prioritization of reason, science and progress, especially as regards the different ontological 
(concerned with the nature of being) and epistemological (concerned with knowledge and truth) models that it 
puts forth and their involvement in aesthetic movements. For Barthes, the Eiffel Tower is not only the 
universal symbol of Paris but tellingly the symbol of “modernity, of communication, of science” (4). 
 

 
Image 4.1 The Eiffel Tower. 15 May 1888: Start of construction of second stage 

 
Built in 1889 by Gustave Eiffel for the Centennial Exposition in Paris, the tower is a monument to human 
ingenuity and innovative engineering, its thousands of steel plates, bolts, beams and screws constructing an 
empty structure whose main aim is to reach for the sky and allow Parisians to view the metropolitan landscape 
from a height of over 300 meters for the first time ever. In becoming the tallest building of the world in its 
time (324 m), the tower materializes and metaphorically captures the spirit of modernity in its desire to dream 
ahead, to move on, to fly high, or else to progress. Following Walter Benjamin’s “Angel of History,” it turns 
its back on a landlocked past and the detritus of history to face the future with the newly acquired confidence 
of a world that has invested in the almost unlimited possibilities promised by new machines and technologies.  

This only works to prove what commentators have consistently remarked about modernity. It is a 
period deeply marked by the emergence of new types of knowledge, sciences and inventions, from Galileo 
and Copernicus’s scientific revolutions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to steam trains and 
telephones in the nineteenth and satellites in the twentieth. What needs to be grasped at this point is that 
embedded in modernity’s scientific advances is a new way of relating to the world and a new position granted 
to the human being. Nature is no longer to be contemplated. It is to be investigated and explored. Isaac 
Newton is famously said to have needed to inquire into the causes that made an apple fall to the ground 
instead of flying skywards in order to formulate the law of gravity. Nature turns into an object of inquiry and 
experimentation, a book that must be analysed and explained. In this light, the Eiffel Tower may be said to 
embody modernity’s fullest expression. By allowing its visitors to enjoy a “bird’s eye view,” it gives birth to a 
“new sensibility of vision” and signals the advent of a new perception. Visitors are encouraged to “read” and 
“decipher” the world at their feet and to “see things in their structure” (9). In Barthes’s own words,  
 

154 
 



Effie Yiannopoulou 
 

every visitor to the Tower makes structuralism without knowing it […] in Paris spread out 
beneath him, he spontaneously distinguishes separate—because known—points—and yet 
does not stop linking them, perceiving them within a great functional space; in short he 
separates and groups; […] What is, in fact, a panorama? An image we attempt to decipher, in 
which we try to recognize known sites, to identify landmarks.(9-10)  

 

 
Image 4.2 Panoramic view from the Eiffel Tower. 

 
Visitors to the tower, in other words, do not just “see” Paris. With the help of their “intelligence,” they 
“interpret” and make sense of it by means of identifying known landmarks (the Bois de Boulogne or the Arc 
de Triomphe) and the routes that connect them (roads, rivers), grouping, classifying and organizing the 
spectacle of Paris to satisfy the demand for immediate comprehensibility. Just as the job of modern scientists 
is to interrogate the world around them, to order it into categories based on data gleaned from experimentation 
and observation, to unearth and formulate rules and systems that underpin the laws of nature, visitors to the 
tower adopt the same modern gaze to render the cityscape, its life and history intelligible. As pointed out by 
Barthes, the panoramic vision that they are confronted with, and the experience of successfully orienting 
themselves in the city space before them, confers pleasure and “euphoria.” He suggests that this happens 
primarily for three reasons. First, the view from the top of the tower allows visitors to form a “continuous 
image of Paris” (10) which is the result of a process of “decipherment” (explanation) (10) that is complete, 
without any gaps. Visitors are in no doubt as to where they are in relation to Paris. Second, for this very 
reason, it offers the viewers a position of “superiority,” literally because they stand on a platform higher than 
anyone else but also intellectually because they have been proved to possess the mental and perceptual agility 
that puts them in charge of the spectacle. Paris has been “confronted” and “possessed” (14) by visitors that are 
installed in the position of “subjects who know” and can control their knowledge of themselves and the world 
around them. Finally, the tower’s panoramic vision causes euphoria because it places the observer “outside” 
the spectacle under observation and underscores his position of power over a world that is impacted upon and 
hence discursively framed and contained without being able to return the gaze. As Barthes writes in the 
essay’s closing line, at the top of the Eiffel Tower “one can feel oneself cut off from the world and yet the 
owner of a world” (my emphasis, 17). 

This last example, and Barthes’s essay as a whole, clearly suggests that the questioning, scientific 
“attitude” towards the world fostered in modernity is underpinned by a re-conceptualization of the human as 
all powerful centre of the universe (in his “new” position at the top of the Tower), confirmed in his knowledge 
of himself and his surroundings, a self-present agent that acts upon and (mentally) “owns” the spectacle of the 
real. It is fair to claim that the modern subject comes across as a true “individual,” a self that has an 
“undivided” experience of itself in relation to others. This means that there are no doubts, gaps or ruptures in 
his knowledge of who or where he is and he can be said, therefore, to inhabit the space of a “unified” and 
“coherent” identity. What fuels this empowering articulation of subjectivity, often referred to as “modern 
individualism,” is the belief in the power of human intelligence to control the self and the world with the help 
of reason. Modernity is regularly associated with the rise of rationalism that finds its finest expression in the 
works of Enlightenment philosophers such as John Locke and Immanuel Kant. When French philosopher 
René Descartes writes in Discourse of Method “I existed without doubt, by the fact that I was persuaded, or 
indeed by the mere fact that I thought at all […] I am, I exist, is necessarily true, every time I express it or 
conceive of it in my mind” (103), he gives voice to the modern conviction that to be human is to be able to 
exercise reason. Rather than being conceived as the product of external, usually divine, forces and plans—

which was the dominant view of the human until the Renaissance—the modern subject is staged as the 
measure of all things, in charge of his destiny and a key agent in the development of knowledge. In 
Enlightenment humanist discourses, human-ness becomes intimately bound to the exercise of the subject’s 
rational faculty and, through it, to structures of knowledge, so much so that the Self is taken to be a function 
not so much of what the human being knows as of the way in which he knows things (Gandhi 29). This close 
connection that exists between structures of modern epistemology (how we know the world) and subjectivity 
(who we are) has had serious implications, over the last few centuries, not only for political, social and 
cultural life in Europe and North America but also for aesthetic production.  

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.2 The Politics of Modernity 

As regards the impact of modern discourses on social and political life, suffice it to point out that the modern 
re-casting of humanity as the source of meaning and action in the world fueled and sustained a widely shared 
representation of the individual (subject) as inherently valuable. This led to the emergence of emancipatory 
discourses that worked to protect and improve human existence. Science changed not only the way humans 
viewed the world or, as we have just seen, the notion of the human itself but also transformed the way 
societies worked, their political systems and social possibilities. The scientific discontent with the self-evident 
in nature was translated into political and social dissent and anti-authoritarian struggle. Ideas about progress, 
universal justice, individual freedom and emancipation, as expressed by philosophers and political thinkers 
from Kant to Karl Marx, were enlisted to challenge social, political and religious injustice, initiating 
revolutions that saw the end of absolute monarchy, the rise of parliamentarianism, the curtailing of the 
church’s power, increased civil rights for larger classes of people, the gradual democratization of a world that 
became gradually transformed beyond recognition in the name of human progress.  

Modernity’s emancipatory project has had its defenders and critics. Key among its recent supporters is 
the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas who explains the current problems attendant on the fragmentation 
and the commodification of life brought about by contemporary global capitalism by arguing that modernity’s 
aims have not yet been fully realized. In his view, universal emancipation is still a vital part of political 

156

critique and modernity an unfinished project (Habermas; Malpas, Lyotard 37, The Postmodern 51-55). At the 
other end, postmodern thinker Jean-François Lyotard challenged the premises of modern discourses, their 
classificatory gaze and desire to create all-explaining systems of thought—what he called “grand 
narratives”—which, in his view, inevitably led to the exclusion of marginal perspectives (Lyotard, The 
Postmodern Condition). Lyotard is not alone in his critical reading of modernity. His critique is in line with 
(though not identical to) early-twentieth-century modernist and avant-garde denunciation of modern 
rationalism but also with a number of late-twentieth and early twenty-first century feminist and especially 
postcolonial thinkers who have identified the central role race has played in modernization and the ways in 
which modern (and contemporary) racial hierarchies and the idea of white supremacy are rooted in the 
Enlightenment’s valorization of rationality (for more on modernity’s racial ideas see West and Nadell). We 
must not forget that parallel to their struggle for progress and emancipation, Europeans engaged in the 
infamous slave trade for three hundred years (it ended in 1807) and spent the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries building colonial Empires on the strength not only of military prowess but, crucially, a set of 
ideological assumptions that promoted the “scientifically” proven and “objectively” verified superiority of the 
white race over other races, some of which were codified as non-human. The idea of white supremacy, as the 
African-American philosopher and activist Cornel West remarks, is “endemic to the very structure of modern 
discourse” (47). His claim explains the longevity and enormous impact of (scientific) racism on life and 
thought in the West over the last few centuries and at once uncovers a major paradox in the conceptual make 
up of the modern. 

2.3 Modern Aesthetics: Realism  

In the field of aesthetic production, modernity has found its most expressive manifestation in the ideologies of 
realism which have dominated literary and artistic creation since the eighteenth century. Realism’s 
complexity, multifaceted character and radical potential have already been presented in an earlier chapter in 
this book. For the moment, what merits consideration, as it stands to shed light on why modernists and 
postmodernists critiqued it so rigorously, is the extent to which realism embodies the “gaze” of modernity in 
its writing conventions and textual workings. What also needs to be grasped is that the term, when employed 
especially by its postmodernist critics, alludes to a mode of representation (of the real) that exceeds the 
historical and generic bounds of the nineteenth-century realist novel. It extends into contemporary popular 
culture to encompass present-day soap operas, TV games or news programmes which continue to enact 
realism’s fundamental principles by offering narratives about the world that insist on comprehensibility, 
closure, structural order and empowerment for readers. Life likeness is perhaps realism’s most commented 
upon attribute. The standard academic view of realism, also voiced by many of its practitioners, draws 
attention to its mimetic and reflectionist impulse, its desire, as it were, to provide an unmediated access to the 
real in ways that sustain verisimilitude. It is worth remembering that the classic metaphor regularly used to 
describe realism’s effects is that of the open window. The world of objects depicted realistically on a canvas 
or coming alive through the words on a page is likened to the world outside one’s open window. Standing by 
the window frame, the subject-spectator-reader observes that world uninterrupted, undetected and, as a true 
“voyeur,” unacknowledged by the life outside that continues its course indifferent to his presence (Jay 184). 
What underlies this popular understanding of the text-world relationship in realism is the assumption that the 
realist text offers readers immediate access to its textual universe. Nothing impedes their vision, allowing 
them to become absorbed into the workings of the plot.  

Poststructuralist and postmodernist readers of realism have been quick to identify the fallacy implicit 
in this position, calling it an illusion and a “fantasy” (Lyotard, “Answering the Question” 74). In their view, 
realism does not so much give us reality as “make” the world appear real (Malpas, Jean-François 44). This is 
achieved in two ways. First, realism effaces its own textuality; it “offers itself as transparent” (Belsey 51) by 
not calling attention to its own textual processes and language tools. Second, it creates a sense of recognizable 
reality by recycling familiar knowledge about the world. Realism assembles its juxtapositions and 
complexities “out of what we already know, and it is for this reason that we experience it as realistic” (Belsey 
51). Even when readers are confronted with surprises in action, twists, contradictions or changes of codes (the 
life-like turned fantastic), the experience of reading a realist text is ultimately reassuring, according to Jean-
François Lyotard, as one of its key aims is “to preserve various consciousnesses from doubt.” Its objective is 
“to stabilize the referent, to arrange it according to a point of view which endows it with a recognizable

meaning, to reproduce the syntax and vocabulary which enable the addressee to decipher images and 
sequences quickly, and so arrive easily at the consciousness of his own identity” (The Postmodern 74). 
Lyotard draws attention here to realism’s desire to create positions of intelligibility for its readers that promote 
comprehensibility both of the world and the self by presenting what is already known either in terms of shared 
knowledge about real-life situations (for example, spatial, temporal or human relations) or generic rules (in 
writing these would include a linear narrative structure, decipherable characters, largely reliable narrators and 
a final resolution). The reader is ultimately reassured about his knowledge of the world and his own identity 
and, in this sense, is shown to adopt the “gaze” of modernity, figuratively placed at the top of the Eiffel 
Tower. He is encouraged, by the conventions of realism, to organize the text before him into a “connected 
space” (Barthes 10) in a way that confers a sense of 
“euphoria” on him for having proved his decoding 
skills and knowledge of the (social or narrative) 
system correct. As we shall see next, the Eiffel 
Tower seat, and by extension realism’s inscription 
of modern epistemology in its textual workings, is 
one that most modernists did not care to occupy. 
They set out, in fact, to blow it up with the force 
accorded them by their violent, provocatively 
disjointed and complex creative styles. 

3. Modernism 

3.1 The Principal Assumptions 

Modernism is regarded as an aesthetic and cultural 
reaction to modernity and modernization which is 
international and interdisciplinary in character. It is 
part of the modern, sharing in its unabated 
enthusiasm for the new, for change and 
experimentation, and directing its energies towards 
the future. It is also, however, at once often critical 
of modernity’s certainties and ambivalent about its 
investment in rationalism and all its byproducts: 
technological advancement, industrialization, 
urbanization, new forms of mass communication 
and entertainment, speed and travel, the very notion 
of progress itself (in time, space, society and even 
the text). It is a historically specific movement 
which made its appearance roughly between the end 
of the nineteenth and the middle of the twentieth 
century in a number of international centres, from 
Berlin and Vienna to Paris, New York and London 
(more on modernism’s internationalism in Bradbury 
and McFarlane).  

As a term, it became widely used in the 
1960s to designate retrospectively work produced in 
a variety of fields—including literature, art, music 
and architecture—by groups of writers and artists 
who shared a commitment to formal 
experimentation and radical stylistic innovation but 
who were frequently at odds with each other in their 
professed intellectual objectives and ideological 
responses to key historical events and forces of the 

Modernist Art:  
 

Modernist art is, in most critical usage, 
reckoned to be the art of what Harold Rosenburg 
calls “the tradition of the new.” It is experimental, 
formally complex, elliptical, contains elements of 

decreation as well as creation, and tends to 
associate notions of the artist’s freedom from 

realism, materialism, traditional genre and form, 
with notions of cultural apocalypse and disaster 

[…] [T]here are several modernisms: an 
intensifying sequence of movements from 

Symbolism on (Post-impressionism, 
Expressionism, Futurism, Imagism, Vorticism, 

Dadaism, Surrealism) often radically at odds, and 
sharp differences of cultural interpretation 
coming from writers apparently stylistically 
analogous (e.g. T. S. Eliot and William Carlos 

Williams). Modernism means the ruffling of the 
realistic surface of literature by underlying 

forces; the disturbance may arise, though, from 
logics solely aesthetic or highly social. Hence, 
modernism still remains a loose label. We can 

dispute about when it starts (French symbolism; 
decadence; the break-up of naturalism) and 
when it ends (Kermode distinguishes “paleo-

modernism” and “neo-modernism” and hence a 
degree of continuity through to postwar art). We 
can regard it as a timebound concept (say 1890-

1930) or a timeless one (including Sterne, 
Donne,Villon, Ronsard). The best focus remains a 

body of major writers (James, Conrad, Proust, 
Mann, Gide, Kafka, Svevo, Joyce, Musil, Faulkner 

in fiction; Strindberg, Pirandello, Wedekind, 
Brecht in drama; Mallarmé, Yeats, Eliot, Pound, 

Rilke, Apollinaire, Stevens in poetry) whose works 
are aesthetically radical, contain striking 

technical innovation, emphasize spatial or 
“fugal” as opposed to chronological form, tend 

towards ironic modes, and involve a certain 
“dehumanization of art”. 
(Fowler, A Dictionary of  

Modern Critical Terms 145) 

158

period (as in the cases of World War I and Fascism) or forms of social transformation (for example, the 
development of mass culture or the women’s suffrage). Notable, in this light, is the case of the avant-garde 
movements, which many critics believe modernism to encompass, whose views on art and life were at times 
underpinned by conflictual ideological orientations. While Filippo Marinetti’s Futurists, for example, idolized 
technology and speed, André Breton and the Surrealists lamented the hold of reason on human imagination, a 
difference in their attitude to modern rationalism 
that calls attention to the discrepant languages that 
the modernists often spoke (more on Modernisms 
in Armstrong and Nicholls and Kolokotroni for the 
manifestos). 

What this example points to, on one level, 
is the arbitrariness involved in any act of literary 
and canonical periodisation while also illustrating, 
in parallel, the heterogeneous and plural character 
of the movement. At the same time, however, it 
allows us a glimpse into the aesthetic and 
ideological struggles that took place in the process 
of producing an identifiable modernist sensibility 
that relies for its identity on the very ideas of 
dissent and contestation. For, if one would wish to 
identify a recurring feature within modernism, in its 
various guises, that would be its attempt to break 
with dominant aesthetic and social rules and its 
desire to develop alternative representational codes. 
Confronted with the catastrophic effects of a the 
First World War (WWI), the emergence of 
feminism, the spread of European colonial empires 
and intensified labour struggles in the early years of 
the twentieth century, modernists lived through and 
responded to a crisis in values that led to the 
erosion of Victorian certainties, especially as 
inscribed in realist works. They felt that 
conventional representational patterns could no 
longer be trusted to get to the truth of their rapidly 
transforming age. Over against the comforting 
familiarity afforded by Realism, they pitted their 
discordant, dissonant, alienating visions. Central to 
their radically anti-representationalist aesthetic 
outlook is their desire for formal innovation and 
technical experimentation with language, time, 
space, character construction and perspective. It is 
through texts that are almost routinely branded complex, obscure and disorienting that modernists conduct a 
sustained inquiry into the certainty of reality and the role of art in meaning-making processes. At the same 
time, they register their deep skepticism towards the idea of the unified, self-present human subject through 
their efforts to represent individual consciousness and in their concern with introspection and psychology.  
 

3.2 Modernist Epistemology: The Turn Inwards 

To explore how some of these key modernist assumptions become articulated in the field of literature, I would 
now like to turn to a fictional narration that is thought to constitute one of the earliest examples of modernist 
writing in English. Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (1899) tells the story of Charlie Marlow who travels to 
the African state of Congo, a Belgian colony at the end of the nineteenth century, to take a steamboat up the 
river Congo in search of ivory and the elusive ivory trader Mr. Kurtz. The account of Marlow’s encounter 

Futurism:  
 

The most important Italian avant-garde art 
movement of the 20th century, Futurism 

celebrated advanced technology and urban 
modernity. Committed to the new, its members 
wished to destroy older forms of culture and to 

demonstrate the beauty of modern life – the 
beauty of the machine, speed, violence and change. 

Futurism was first announced on February 20, 
1909, when the Paris newspaper Le Figaro 

published a manifesto by the Italian poet and 
editor Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Marinetti 

coined the word Futurism to reflect his goal of 
discarding the art of the past and celebrating 

change, originality, and innovation in culture and 
society. Marinetti’s manifesto glorified the new 

technology of the automobile and the beauty of its 
speed, power, and movement. Exalting violence 

and conflict, he called for the sweeping repudiation 
of traditional values and the destruction of 
cultural institutions such as museums and 

libraries. The futurists’ enthusiasm for modernity 
and the machine ultimately led them to celebrate 
the arrival of World War I. By its end, the group’s 

influence as an important avant-garde was 
significantly reduced, though it continued through 

the 1920s, and, during that time several of its 
members went on to embrace Fascism, making 

Futurism the only twentieth century avant-garde 
to have embraced far right politics.

with cultural difference at the “heart of darkness” calls 
attention to the novel’s preoccupation with the ethics of 
nineteenth-century European imperialism and the 
ultimately ambivalent and suspect politics underpinning the 
construction of traditionally opposed categories such as 
civilization and savagery, interiority and exteriority, self 
and other. Interestingly enough, for our purposes, the 
narrative allies its cultural critique with the challenge it 
extends to the ability of either language or human 
perception to record the real with absolute certainty. The 
Africans’ harsh living conditions under colonialism and 
Europe’s exploitative relationship to the natives’ land are 
presented to the reader through recourse to Marlow’s 
primitivist fantasies about the, at once, repellent and 
alluring dark continent, his thoughts and emotional 
responses as he endeavours to map out the African 
darkness and his own self. That the novel ultimately waters down its critique by revealing itself to be shot 
through with dominant racialist discourses of the nineteenth century should not detract from the fact that it 
conducts an exciting epistemological shift in the representation of the real. It transfers attention from the 
object (outer) word to the inner space of the mind and undermines in this move the fantasy of clear vision (of 
the world) structuring both Realism and modern epistemology. I shall quote here and briefly comment upon a 
short passage from the novel in which the question of knowledge is a vital concern. 
 

Joseph Conrad, from Heart of Darkness  
 

I would not have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz, but I went for him near enough to a lie. 
You know I hate, detest, and can’t bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but 
simply because it appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lies—which is 
exactly what I hate and detest in the world—what I want to forget. It makes me miserable and sick, 
like biting something rotten would do. Temperament, I suppose. Well, I went near enough to it by 
letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in Europe. I 
became in an instant as much of a pretence as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims. This simply because 
I had a notion it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time I did not see—you 
understand. He was just a word for me. I did not see the man in the name any more than you do. Do 
you see him? Do you see the story? Do you see anything? It seems to me I am trying to tell you a 
dream—making a vain attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation, that 
commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt, that notion of 
being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams. …”  

He was silent for a while.  
“… No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey the life-sensation of any given epoch of 

one's existence—that which makes its truth, its meaning—its subtle and penetrating essence. It is 
impossible. We live, as we dream—alone …” 

 He paused again as if reflecting, then added:  
“Of course in this you fellows see more than I could then. You see me, whom you know …” 
It had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one another. For a long time 

already he, sitting apart, had been no more to us than a voice. There was not a word from anybody. 
The others might have been asleep, but I was awake. I listened, I listened on the watch for the 
sentence, for the word, that would give me the clue to the faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative 
that seemed to shape itself without human lips in the heavy night-air of the river. (1778-79)  

 

Stream of Consciousness: 
 

is a narrative technique which seeks to 
record the random and apparently 

illogical flow of impressions passing 
through a character’s mind. The term was 

coined by William James in 1890 in The 
Principles of Psychology and the best 
known English exponents are Dorothy 
Richardson, Virginia Woolf and James 

Joyce.

This is a passage that disputes the priority accorded to visuality in modernity and the structures of absolute 
knowledge that it lends support to. It presents Marlow as an uncertain narrator who doubts his ability “to see” 
the events and characters of his story with clarity. Through his repetitive, almost obsessive questioning, of 
visual intelligibility (“Do you see?”), Marlow voices his anxiety about the possibility of ever attaining full 
knowledge of his world, his past and his own self. Unlike the modern subject’s visual control over the 
spectacle of the real, Marlow’s interpretive faculties appear numbed. He is unsure as to how much he can 
remember or understand about his journey, about Kurtz, who remains inscrutable to the end, or the rest of the 
Pilgrims. His narrative conveys a “dream-sensation,” flowing backwards and forwards in time, rather than 
construct itself as a logically-connected, coherent representational space. To “tell a dream,” Conrad deploys, 
here as elsewhere in the novel, key modernist techniques such as stream-of-consciousness, tunneling and 
interior monologue. These are writing tools widely used across modernist fiction and employed here to 
represent the workings of Marlow’s mind at the moment of contact with the real, to register, as it were, his 
attempts at sense-making which often take the form of blurred, unconnected impressions and memories. The 
novel’s entire structure is, in fact, designed to enact this “dream sensation.” It consists of a series of relayed 
narratives that begin their journey from the mouths of characters whose testimony relies on moments when 
they “fancied” they could see things (1774), such as the Russian sailor, pass through to Marlow’s uncertain 
narration to finally reach an unnamed narrator’s pen. This is an invaginated narrative structure that exposes 
the complexity surrounding the notions of truth and falsehood, almost always enmeshed in attempts to delimit 
the borders of the factual, and makes truth detection into a process that guides readers slowly into the inner 
recesses of the perceiving subject’s consciousness, in search of a reality that recedes and fades. As Marlow 
muses at another point in the text, “the reality—the reality, I tell you—fades. The inner truth is hidden—
luckily, luckily” (1784).  

As a final comment on the passage above, what merits consideration is the “faint uneasiness inspired” 
by Marlow’s narrative in his listeners and readers alike. The darkness that slowly descends over the river 
Thames and Marlow’s companions literalises the challenge that his obscure narrative poses to their vision and 
understanding, causing the uneasiness resulting from the lack of complete knowledge to replace “euphoria” 
and self-contentment. As a piece of modernist literature, Heart of Darkness invites reading positions that 
dispense with readers as “subjects who know” and confronts them with what exceeds the visible bounds of 
immediate comprehension. There is a politics to this readerly uneasiness (caused by the text’s gaps and 
ruptures) which goes beyond being a self-indulgent game in textual self-consciousness. Conrad’s novel 
initiates new contact points among the text, the subject and the world by engaging with the cultural and 
historical discourses of its time in a way that emphasizes the processes and failings of perception and the 
inadvisability of prizing apart the real and the psychic. One might argue that part of his novel’s anti-
imperialist critique derives its energy precisely from the very epistemological uncertainty it produces, which 
invites readers to attend to the necessity of rethinking the cultural “certainties” that are foundational to forms 
of white supremacy and modern raciology in late nineteenth century Europe. 

As it has been suggested so far, modernism’s desire to develop representational alternatives rests on 
the belief that reality is not external to the subject but always already internally defined. Many of the stylistic 
features encountered in the fiction of modernist authors, from Katherine Mansfield to D. H. Lawrence and 
James Joyce, are directly related to their fascination with introspection. Virginia Woolf provides a theoretical 
elaboration of this shared belief when, in her seminal essay “Modern Fiction,” she allies her understanding of 
the real as a “semi-transparent envelope” with the need to formulate a new literary aesthetic. If life, or spirit, 
“is not a series of gig-lamps symmetrically arranged” but a “luminous halo […] surrounding us from the 
beginning of consciousness to the end,” as she argues, then the job of fiction is to “convey this […] unknown 
and uncircumscribed spirit” and the job of the novelist to invent a fictional idiom, other than realism’s, 
capable of recording “the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall […] disconnected 
and incoherent” (1924). Clearly acquainted with Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theories that are widely 
debated across the intellectual circles of modernism in the first half of the twentieth century, Woolf abandons 
the poetics of realism to urge fellow authors to initiate a style of writing which, in its fragmentation and 
discontinuities, seems strangely enough truer to life.  

The stream-of-consciousness style and interior monologues are fictional techniques which are 
developed exactly as a response to the demand that fiction represents “moments of being” and impressions in 
the disconnected order in which they are perceived rather than offer a linear, causal narrative made out of 
objectively verified facts. They are well-suited, in this sense, to posing a challenge to our modern vision. 
Woolf makes extensive use of interior monologues in novels such as Mrs. Dallaway or To the Lighthouse to 

161 
 



Modernist and Postmodernist Fiction(s) 
 

encourage a revision of Victorian gender structures, as does Dorothy Richardson in Pilgrimage, while James 
Joyce journeys into, and through, the mind of his protagonist Stephen Dedalus to make a comment on Irish 
culture and its divisive nationalist and religious politics in the early twentieth century. 

The modernist interest in the invisible realities of the mind is also vividly registered in the field of 
visual art. Avant-garde movements such as Surrealism and Dadaism, in particular, turn their backs on pictorial 
realism and employ Freudian symbols to represent the unconscious, to depict dreams and hallucinations. 
Salvador Dali’s Surrealist painting The Persistence of Memory (1931) depicts a seaside landscape that does 
not aspire to life-likeness, only remotely resembling his native Catalonia in the depiction of the distant golden 
cliffs.

His painting confronts us, rather, with fragments—ants, melting clocks and an unidentifiable, deformed 
creature in a state of sleep—which are drawn from Dali’s imagination. It is fair to say that their function is 
more symbolic than literal as there are no immediately visible connections between them and their 
surroundings and no meaningful narrative that can be construed in relation to them upon first making eye 
contact with the painting. They seem more as having come out of a dream—Dali having described his 
paintings as “hand painted dream photographs” (https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/1168-2—or as 
depicting a dream state which is clearly suggested by the slumbering creature. If melting clocks and ants 
allude to time and decay as central concerns in this painting, dream time, which is amorphous, unconnected, 
bearing the flowing traces of memories and experiences, seems to be invoked here to destabilize, even 
collapse, our sense of an orderly, daily temporal and spatial reality.

The Surrealists were not alone in 
exploring the psychic by way of investigating the 
intricacies of time. Modernists across the arts 
worked persistently with notions of uneven 
temporality influenced as they were especially by 
Henri Bergson’s ideas on time. They were 
concerned with the claustrophobic hold of 
consumer, capitalist time on everyday life but also 
eager to develop formal tools to represent the 
existence of overlapping or competing 
temporalities particularly as illustrated in the case 
of the temporally split subject—when psychic time 
(taken up by memories and thoughts) runs parallel 
to, intervenes in, but is not identical with, 
“external” time (for more on modernism and time 
see Armstrong). In the field of literature, Virginia 
Woolf offers a good example of a writer who, like 
Dali, foregrounds the complexity of time through 
her focus on the subject’s psychology. With the 
help of interior monologues that allow readers to 
hop from one character’s consciousness to 
another’s, she contrasts public with private time (Childs 171). Thirty pages of private thoughts may be 
experienced by a character (and a reader) as being 
long-lasting but have actually taken a minute in 
the “public” time of the narrative. It is noteworthy 
that, in the second part of her novel To the 
Lighthouse (where the effects of the First World 
War on the Ramsay family are made known), 
Woolf reverses the conventional temporal scheme, 
prioratising emotional responses to the war and 
subjective time at the expense of “facts” that 
belong to public life (battles and the deaths of 
family members) which are given almost in 
passing in square brackets. By reversing 
established priorities in the representation of 
temporality, the novel foregrounds the existence of 
parallel realities and suggests the importance of 
psychic life not only in understanding the 
individual subject but also social relations. 

3.3 Language and Representation in 
Modernism 

Language and representation are central to the 
modernist sensibility as already suggested. Formal 
experimentation is a vital aspect of modernism’s 
aesthetics partly because its re-conceptualisation 
of the real encouraged the invention of new forms 
of expression and partly because new ideas 
regarding language and the role of art made their 
appearance in the first half of the twentieth 
century. Whether accused of having lost its ability 
to deliver the truth (when World War I propaganda 
was revealed) or its transparency, as an immediate result of Ferdinand de Saussure’s new linguistic theories, 

Henri Bergson (1859-1941): 
 

French philosopher who in Time and Free Will 
(1889) maintained that facts and matter, which 
are the objects of discursive reason, are only the 

outer surface that has to be penetrated by 
intuition in order to achieve a vision in depth of 
reality. He distinguished between chronological 

time, the time of history (hours, minutes and 
seconds), and duration, the varying speed at which 

the mind apprehends experiences according to 
their intensity and meaning for the individual 

which is not necessarily identical with 
chronological time. His work changed the way 

Modernists represented time in fiction. 
(Childs 49) 

Surrealism: 
 

originated in the late 1910s and early 1920s as a 
literary movement that experimented with a new 
mode of expression called automatic writing, or 

automatism, which sought to release the unbridled 
imagination of the subconscious. Officially 

consecrated in Paris in 1924 with the publication 
of the Manifesto of Surrealism by the poet and 

critic André Breton (1896-1966), Surrealism 
became an international intellectual and political 
movement. Breton, a trained psychiatrist, along 

with French poets Louis Aragon (1897–1982), Paul 
Éluard (1895-1952), and Philippe Soupault (1897-

1990), were influenced by the psychological 
theories and dream studies of Sigmund Freud 

(1856-1939) and the political ideas of Karl Marx 
(1818-1883). Using Freudian methods of free 

association, their poetry and prose drew upon the 
private world of the mind, traditionally restricted 

by reason and societal limitations, to produce 
surprising, unexpected imagery. The cerebral and 
irrational tenets of Surrealism find their ancestry 

in the clever and whimsical disregard for tradition 
fostered by Dadaism a decade earlier.

Modernist and Postmodernist Fiction(s) 
 

language became so ineluctably connected to notions of truth and the real that any discussion about the world 
made engagement with language a necessity. I shall briefly discuss here the opening pages of James Joyce’s 
novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) as example of modernist fiction that calls attention to the 
workings of language in a literary text, and its role in constructions of the subject and the world, through its 
discontinuous and fragmented form. 

James Joyce, from A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man  
 
Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and 
this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo [...]  
His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.  
He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon 
platt.  
 

O, the wild rose blossoms 
On the little green place. 

 
He sang that song. That was his song.  
 

O, the green wothe botheth. 
 
When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold. His mother put on the oilsheet. That had the 
queer smell.  
His mother had a nicer smell than his father. She played on the piano the sailor's hornpipe for him to 
dance. He danced:  
 

Tralala lala, 
Tralala tralaladdy, 

Tralala lala, 
Tralala lala. 

 
Uncle Charles and Dante clapped. They were older than his father and mother but uncle Charles was 
older than Dante.  
Dante had two brushes in her press. The brush with the maroon velvet back was for Michael Davitt 
and the brush with the green velvet back was for Parnell. Dante gave him a cachou every time he 
brought her a piece of tissue paper.  
The Vances lived in number seven. They had a different father and mother. They were Eileen's father 
and mother. When they were grown up he was going to marry Eileen. He hid under the table. His 
mother said:  
—O, Stephen will apologize.  
Dante said:  
—O, if not, the eagles will come and pull out his eyes.—  
 

Pull out his eyes, 
Apologize, 
Apologize, 

Pull out his eyes. 
Apologize, 

Pull out his eyes, 
Pull out his eyes, 

Apologize.

Effie Yiannopoulou 
 

This is admittedly compact modernist prose, ruptured and difficult to get into. Joyce’s opening offers us a 
series of disconnected images by way of an introduction rather than clear contextual information on his Irish 
protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his family: a father reading a bedtime story to his baby son; a baby boy 
wetting his bed; a mother playing the piano; Dante threatening a young Stephen who finds solace in 
translating her threats into a song. Clearly experimenting with the representation of the real, the fragmented 
vision of Stephen’s early life succeeds in highlighting the importance of language and storytelling in 
conveying ideas about characters and their world. The text attracts interest to the question of representation in 
a number of ways. For one, the chapter opens with a story. Baby Stephen identifies with “baby tuckoo,” the 
main character in the story his father is reading to him, and so is shown to become aware of his existence with 
the help of a fictional construction. Almost deliberately, Joyce’s artistic portrait insists on underlining the 
mediating role of storytelling in one’s self-understanding and identity formation from its very first lines. 
Second, the text mimics the embryonic prattle of baby Stephen as a way of articulating his perspective. It 
attempts to dramatise Stephen’s consciousness through the deployment of infantile language. The use of 
simple and babyish vocabulary (“moocow”), abrupt and arbitrary juxtapositions verbally represent baby 
Stephen’s perception of his surroundings. This is a writing strategy that Joyce will repeat in the course of the 
novel to convey information about Stephen’s thoughts and state of mind while he is growing up, suggesting 
thus strongly the existence of a vital connection between subjective perception and representation.  

Finally, the very elliptical structure of the passage—the missing ties amongst images and characters 
that prevent immediate comprehension—not only causes confusion in readers but encourages us to think 
about reality (Stephen’s and the text’s) as interpretable material, as representation. As readers, we need to read 
on to find out more about nationalist politics in early-twentieth century Ireland, religious conflicts and family 
relations before we can make sense of this first chapter. The allusion to the nationalist leaders Michael Davitt 
and Charles Parnell or the panic caused in Dante by the mere suggestion that Stephen might get married to the 
Protestant neighbour Eileen Vance acquire meaning in retrospect and only after we have learned more about 
the ugly divisions scarring Stephen’s family (Mr. Dedalus and Mr. Casey vs. Dante) and Irish society as a 
whole (Catholics vs. Protestants; Catholics vs. nationalists and Charles Parnell and so on). In other words, 
negotiating the gaps in meaning that mark the first chapter requires that we return to it to supply meaning. 
Through this act of repetition, which is at once a form of readerly alienation, Joyce’s modernist text 
foregrounds its standing as decodable material, as a system of signs that require interpretation and are not 
naturally endowed with meaning. No longer an automatic act of decoding, the reading response that Joyce’s 
novel invites is self-aware and ready to acknowledge the importance of language in our contact with reality, 
its immense possibilities and inbuilt potential for disturbing the old. The opening pages set the tone for what is 
to be a rather different portrait of an artist in the making, Stephen’s character being presented throughout as an 
assembly of fragments, conflicting thoughts, writings and feelings that he experiences about himself, his 
awakening sexuality, his religious conversion and his love of country.  

To produce Stephen’s disjointed portrait, Joyce seems to borrow from the language of Cubism which 
foregrounds the ideas of collage and multiple, often juxtaposed, perspectives.

Image 4.4 Pablo Picasso. Maya with her Doll (1938). 

 
Pablo Picasso’s portrait of his daughter Maya with her Doll (1938) illustrates amply the discontinuity resulting 
from the simultaneous coexistence of opposed perspectives. The girl’s face is represented in profile and 
forward facing at once, her head unnaturally enlarged, her legs positioned at a bizarre angle in relation to her 
body. Rather than produce a recognizable impression of his daughter, Picasso creates a painting that flaunts its 
artificiality and speaks through—and almost in a self-absorbed way about—its lines, shapes and colours. It is 
underwritten by the assumption that the world can no longer be regarded from one single perspective or its 
meanings contained in a single posture, script or language.  

For the modernists, this doubleness of vision is foundational to their understanding of the world as 
fundamentally uncertain and is the result of different but interlocking historical and intellectual forces that are 
at work around the turn of the twentieth century: World War I, as the most destructive war ever, has eroded 
faith in the stability of life and the ability of language to tell the truth; Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) has 
undermined belief in the divine by proclaiming that “God is dead” and dismissed the existence of absolute 
truth; Freud and psychoanalysis have reinvented the subject as divided, not all knowing, because always 
determined by the unconscious which evades his control; Karl Marx (1818-1883), in his turn, has exposed the 
historically conditioned, hence transformable, nature of identity through his attention to capitalist modes of 
production and their role in the construction of the bourgeois subject; even science has brought about a 
paradigm shift in understandings of the physical universe, Albert Einstein overturning Newtonian physics 
through his Theory of Relativity and Werner Heisenberg undermining the possibility of ever knowing 
anything about the material universe with absolute certainty through his Uncertainty Principle (for more on 
the forces around modernism see Childs and Bradshaw & Dettmar).  

The challenge posed by all these discourses to the clear vision of a calculable world is immense. It is 
little surprise then that language itself, whose job was traditionally to render what surrounds us visible, is seen 
by many modernists as being in crisis, unable to turn such a rapidly, and often, violently transformed reality 
into meaningful signs. Its transparency gone, language now figures as a land that invites exploration, its limits 
and its potential needing to be reconfigured, which is what the modernists do when they play with form, 
perspective and means of expression.  

What should be made clear at this point is that key amongst the intellectual forces that motivate the 
modernist penchant for language games and formal innovation is a set of linguistic and philosophical ideas 
about language that come into effect and are widely debated across literary circles in the first half of the 

166

twentieth century. It has been already suggested in previous chapters that the emergence of symbolism in late 
nineteenth century was instrumental in uncovering the plurality inherent in the structures of language (a heart 
may have more than one meaning as a symbol) and contributed to the severing of the bond between the word 
and the thing it designates. The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure cut this bond for good by proposing, in 
his Course in General Linguistics (1916), that language is both arbitrary and relational. In other words, there 
is no natural link connecting the (concept of an) object in the real world and their lexical sound (it is totally 
arbitrary why we call a chair chair); second, signs produce meaning because of their difference from each 
other in a network of signs which is the signifying system and not because meaning is divinely conferred 
(Belsey 136)—red, as a sign, may mean erotically desirable in a romantic story but threateningly violent in a 
vampire film.  

The reason why Saussure’s theories of language are important to modernists and postmodernists alike 
is because they foreground meaning as not naturally given but as constructed (socially or psychically), plural 
and contextual. What also merits a mention in this context is that close to the time when Saussure makes his 
linguistic theories public, the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein also formulates philosophies of language 
which contribute to a reevaluation of the relationship between reality and meaning-making. Wittgenstein 
believes that our physical ways of being, over which we have no choice, are distinguished and identified by 
our words, our ability to speak, by particular language games. Naming, that is language, is what allows us to 
access what he calls “forms of life” and make it signify (Fleming 566). Given the promising insights implicit 
in these formulations and their impact on intellectual life, it is not surprising that, for many writers and artists, 
language is now a space where one can intervene in the representation of the real and the social. Specifically 
for the modernists, language itself becomes a new form whose limits must be investigated and are regularly 
stretched beyond recognition to discover its potential. Note, for example, Giacomo Balla’s painting Abstract 
Speed: The Car Has Passed (1913).

passing car” (for more on Balla’s painting see here). Attention to verisimilitude has been replaced by abstract 
lines and colour schemes that speak to the viewer in ways that are not definite but which convey the explosive 
energy of the modern, the new. In a sense, form itself figures as the subject of this openly anti-representational 
painting, treated as a new language that is designed to communicate a new vision which, in its turn, signifies 
on more than one level. In a similar register, Joyce’s novel too signifies on more than one level, deploying the 
plurality inherent in representation to level its critique against the cultural conventions and stifling identities 
dominant in early-twentieth century Ireland. His protagonist develops a modernist sensibility as an artist and 
transforms the word into a site of experimentation and resistance to the given. 

3.4 The Politics of Modernist Form 

What I have suggested through this very brief reading of Joyce is what Michael Levenson also subscribes to 
when he remarks that attention to “form” need not be necessarily opposed to “content” (3). Levenson 
challenges here a rather pervasive reading of modernism as a solipsistic, formalist aesthetic movement that 
obsessively pursues formal innovation for its sake, concentrates on the individual rather than society and is, 
therefore, removed from real life. This line of argumentation can be traced back to the hostility expressed 
towards modernism by a group of Marxist critics in the years before World War II, a position famously 
represented by the Hungarian critic Georg Lucáks (in his quarrel especially with his fellow Marxist, the 
German playwright, Bertolt Brecht). Lucáks believed that the Modernists’ interest in the psychic and spiritual 
life of the subject is premised on a lack of concern with the material conditions of living and with history. This 
renders them, and their fictional creations, asocial, ahistorical and unable to act upon society or be acted upon 
by it (477). In his view, only realist aesthetics is well placed to stimulate social change because political action 
can only be the work of a coherently conceived subject in an epistemologically determinate universe.  

Lucáks’s argument has proved influential and has lived on in contemporary criticisms leveled against 
the various strands of modernism—and more generally experimental fiction and art—even today. It is, 
however, important to remember that the last thirty years have witnessed a sustained reevaluation of 
modernist texts and their politics that firmly connects them to their social and cultural contexts. This is a claim 
that might be taken to suggest, on one level, the influence social, historical and cultural circumstances had in 
the development of modernism’s formal attributes. As I have already suggested, epistemological uncertainty 
encouraged writers and artists to experiment with perspective on the canvas (as Picasso did), or on the page 
through the development of writing techniques, such as the stream of consciousness, which represented life 
through a different lens. Levenson argues in a similar vein that the social cataclysms of the early twentieth 
century penetrated modernist invention and gave writers and artists forms suggested by industrial machinery, 
the chuffing of cars (consider Balla’s abstract representation of speed) or, most horribly, the bodies broken 
from war (4).  

At the same time, however, modernists also used narrative form to transform the worlds in which they 
existed. Notable is the case of women modernists who not only employed but actively developed modernist 
writing strategies that allowed them to react both against the conventions of realism and the metaphysics of 
gender oppression dominant in Victorian England—which many felt were embodied in realism’s 
formulations. Characteristically, Dorothy Richardson openly identified realism’s masculinist bias when she 
claimed in her “Foreword” to Pilgrimage that, while surveying the existing patterns of writing around her 
before writing her novel, “she was faced with the choice between following one of the regiments and 
attempting to produce a feminine equivalent to the current masculine realism” (429-430). Writers such as 
Dorothy Richardson, May Sinclair, H. D. Djuna Barnes, Mina Loy and Virginia Woolf focused on women’s 
material lives and thought patterns in ways that disrupted traditional narrative and disturbed Western 
conceptual modes. Richardson, for example, developed the stream-of-consciousness technique and repudiated 
grammatical conventions, such as punctuation, in order to enable Victorian, middle-class women to write 
themselves into a script that offered them a destiny other than marriage. Sinclair unveiled madness as an 
arbitrary but gendered social construction while Woolf, as we have seen, manipulated juxtaposed interior 
monologues to expose and criticize gender conventions (Michael 49-50).  

If this interaction between social context and modernist representation seems to have produced 
transformative social critique, it must also be noted that not all modernist engagement with the world was 
politically progressive. Recent postcolonial readings of key modernist works have uncovered the racialist 
biases implicit in avant-garde experimentalism and in canonical modernist texts. To Chinua Achebe and

Edward Said’s critical analyses of Conrad’s race prejudice—which exists parallel to his challenge to European 
imperialism in a novel such as Heart of Darkness—one may add a more generalized concern recently voiced 
with modernism’s primitivist impulse. We may define “primitivism” as a reaction against the deification of 
rationality and science, the growth of cities, the capitalist obsession with profit and the ideology of progress 
that was registered in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. It led to the search for origins and 
absolutes for unspoiled nature and uncontaminated humanity in non-Western art forms where many 
modernists found inspiration for their creations (for more on primitivism in art see Jordan and Weedon). 
Though it reversed the nineteenth-century racist stereotyping of racial and cultural difference as “negative” 
primitiveness (barbarism) by reevaluating it in positive terms (what was “bad” before is now “good”), 
primitivism left the power structures and essential categories of Western racisms untouched (Africans or 
Polynesians continued to be placed outside history and essentialised). Pablo Picasso’s painting Les 
Demoiselles D’ Avignon (1907) is perhaps one of the best-known cases of primitivism in avant-garde art.

The primitive mask which he borrows from African tribal art not only contributes to the revolution in artistic 
representation that this painting brings about in the West (it privileges flatness and colour; breaks with the 
tradition of perspective; represents broken bodies and ugly 
female prostitutes), but is also posited as what allows him 
to get in touch with his own inner, primordial artistic 
power. Picasso finds inspiration in the energy and the spirit 
of “savagery,” which, though re-contextualised and 
semantically updated, continues to bear as a concept the 
imprint of Europe’s homogenizing racialism. 

In light of the above, one might be justified in 
arguing that modernist politics is not monolithic and unified 
and needs to be interpreted in context. There is much in the 
disruptive modernist form that enables it to intervene in 
structures of authority that support imperialism, bourgeois 
class hegemony or the male-dominated family, according to 
Edward Said and through Marianne DeKoven’s words 
(676). It is possible, however, that it may be caught 
colluding at once with discourses and ideologies that are 
credited with allowing forms of domination to continue 
their work. Such is the case, for example, with modernity’s 
valorisation of progress and novelty which underwrites the 
modernist desire to experiment with representational means 
but which at once underlies Europe’s exclusionary attitude 
towards non-Western cultures that have apparently failed to 
produce signs of such progressive activity (in technology, 
the arts or social organization). Postmodernism, as we shall 
see next, persistently emphasises the importance of context 
in acts of interpretation, an insight that should be a guiding 
light in our own interpretive contact with both the aesthetic 
trends discussed here.

4. The Postmodern 

There is no simple way of defining the postmodern. It is a multifaceted and controversial cultural, 
philosophical and aesthetic formation that has given rise to vexed debates between critics. What may be said 
with certainty is that it has been a major critical and artistic force in numerous areas of intellectual activity—
in literature, art, culture, history, architecture, music, theatre, dance, photography and film—since the term 
was first used in the 1950s and 1960s. The intense disagreement surrounding its meanings and politics may 
be, partly, due to the varied ways in which it has been deployed in all the above fields of thought. It may also, 
however, result from the postmodern’s own resistance to being pinned down to an accessible, citable 
definition. Grasping what escapes the logic and clarity that characterize most definitions (of terms, peoples or 
communities) and celebrating what resists and disrupts them is after all one of its most identifiable features 
(Malpas, The Postmodern 4).  

It is the case that the postmodern is often employed in critical writings to refer to either 
“postmodernism” or “postmodernity,” which begs the question of their relationship. Are they identical or 
opposed notions? As suggested in the introduction, postmodernity is often understood to designate a set of 
intellectual and social conditions, even a historical period, while postmodernism is concerned with aesthetic 
practices, questions of style and representation (in literature and art). In practice, it is difficult to tell them 
apart as the slippage in the use of the two terms (using one in the place of the other) reveals the impossibility 
of separating real living conditions from representation—and this is a recurring idea across postmodernist 
discourses more generally. What is clear enough is that both terms seem tied to a series of transformations that 
shaped the world in the twentieth century especially in the post-World War II years. The stretch of time 
especially since the end of World War II has been often identified as the postmodern era and characterized by 
the breaking down of borders, an increase in forms of human mobility and immigration, the globalization of 
capitalism, the rise in consumerism and the development of new media and communication networks—to list 
only some of the major changes affecting social and cultural organization in the last seventy years.  

This is a particularly mobile world that we are living in where mixing and matching clothes, 
perfumes, cars, types of food, ideas and peoples forms part of our daily routine and, in the eyes of some 
critics, has become almost synonymous with the postmodern of the “anything goes” (it is very “postmodern” 
to eat Chinese food in Athens or wear a Ralph Lauren suit in Moscow, for example). For the French 
philosopher Jean-François Lyotard, however, the daily experience of the “anything goes” in contemporary 
cultures speaks more of “the realism of money” and the capitalist pursuit of profit—which excludes entire 
classes of people pushing them in the margins of need and disenfranchisement (homeless, refugees, asylum 
seekers)—and less of postmodernism as a critical practice. As he observes in The Postmodern Condition, even 
knowledge is now a marketable commodity. Its production is funded and supported on condition that it brings 
money in. “No money, no proof […] no truth,” he writes characteristically. “The games of scientific language 
become the games of the rich, in which whoever is wealthiest has the best chance of being right (The 
Postmodern 45). What I wish to suggest is that, as a form of critical inquiry, postmodernism disrupts and 
deregulates the certainties of this “late” capitalist age rather than supports them. But it performs its task from 
within the system and, therefore, runs the risk of being confounded with it. As Simon Malpas observes, 
postmodernism “operates within the realist [mainstream] context of a given culture to shatter its norms and 
challenge its assumptions, not with a new set of criteria drawn from outside of that culture, but rather by 
showing the contradictions the culture contains, what it represses, refuses to recognise or make unpresentable” 
(The Postmodern 30, 2).  
 This view of the postmodern is also useful in helping us think its connection with modernism. Many 
critics assume that postmodernism follows on from and replaces modernism since the prefix “post,” which 
means “after,” suggests a chronological succession of periods and aesthetic movements. It is a tempting, and 
certainly popular, reading as postmodernist texts often demonstrate an attention to style and representation 
that is shared by modernism’s many strands. The problem with this account, according to Lyotard, is that it 
presents the postmodern as the latest stage in modernity’s development. It makes it seem as though 
postmodernism is part of a linear (historical, social or aesthetic) structure and a narrative of progress that 
postmodernists clearly find problematic and unsatisfactory. As they point out, the postmodern is suspicious of 
continuities and is identified, in Lyotard’s view, as the very moment when a decline in the ability of progress 
to improve life is registered (the first perhaps in two hundred years).  

172 
 



Effie Yiannopoulou 
 

More than all else, however, the postmodern, as suggested earlier, operates within the system it 
critiques. Its job, as a critical practice doing work in literature, art, philosophy and politics, is to investigate the 
assumptions implicit in modernity (Lyotard, The Postmodern Explained 79-80). As such, it cannot be 
regarded as a new age that replaces the modern but rather as a “critical attitude within the modern” that 
challenges its assumptions (Malpas, The Postmodern 41-45; for more on the characteristics of the postmodern 
see Malpas). This critical positioning of the postmodern in relation to the modern is made particularly evident 
in the postmodern’s challenge to questions of novelty and originality, its use of intertextual recycling (of texts, 
fashions, attitudes) as a means of illustrating the textual character of the real and the subject; its ironic re-
creation of the past and history; even in what some recognize as its more “democratic” character which is 
often due to the fact that, in breaking down the dividing lines between high and popular culture, it often 
inhabits the popular and is rendered thus more accessible (Waugh 5). In the following sections, I shall expand 
briefly on some important postmodern ideas regarding the notions of representation, subjectivity and 
difference mainly through discussions of literature, culture and art. 

4.1 Representation 

 
 

 
 
 
Australian film director Baz Luhrmann directed William Shakespeare’s Romeo + Juliet in 1996, with 
Leonardo di Caprio and Claire Danes in the lead roles. The film presents Shakespeare’s play to a modern 
audience in ways that appeal to their taste, film knowledge and life experience. Though it remains faithful to 
the original storyline, the action is transferred to the present, the setting, characters’ clothes and soundtrack are 
contemporary while the editing is fast, jazzy and exciting, designed to cater to the visual needs of a younger 
generation. It is fair to say that the final filmic product is organized around some key postmodernist principles, 
evident especially in its desire to accentuate its artificiality and, consequently, the textual character of the real. 
I shall focus primarily on the film’s opening scene, which delivers the play’s Prologue, and try to tease out 
those of its aspects that contribute to its postmodernist effect. In Romeo + Juliet, Luhrmann presents the 
Prologue as a news bulletin. A female newsreader appears on a TV screen, acting in the place of 
Shakespeare’s narrator, and delivers the original sixteenth-century lines that tell the tragic story of family feud 
and death.

Modernist and Postmodernist Fiction(s) 
 

As soon as the Prologue is completed, a series of rapidly edited camera shots present the city’s skyscrapers, 
the leading characters (the Montagues and the Capulets) and the outbreak of violence caused by the feud 
through a series of newspaper cuttings, headlines and film footage, all relating the families’ quarrels. While 
the media coverage of the civil unrest is unfolding, the first six lines of the Prologue are repeated a second 
time through a voice-over (an unseen narrator speaking in a 
film). At the end of it, the story of the two “star-cross’d 
lovers,” as given in the Prologue, is presented to the viewer 
a third time in the form of written text that flashes across 
the screen at an incredible speed. Throughout the opening, 
the editing is fast and the MTV-type music loud, creating 
tension and leading to a final “explosion” of colour, light, 
music and writing that creates a visual counterpart to the 
story’s emotionally intense ending but in a new medium. 

There are various reasons why Luhrmann’s film 
might be considered postmodernist. For one, it blurs the 
boundary between high and popular culture. It takes a 
theatrical play that constitutes, by general consent, 
“serious” literature and translates it into a filmic 
representation that employs cinematic techniques (fast 
editing and exciting music) used by popular entertainment 
channels and programmes such as MTV or Miami Vice. In 
upsetting the dichotomy between high art and popular 
culture, the film interrogates the values traditionally attached to the two terms and urges us to examine the 
cultural norms that have led to the construction of the opposition (what makes some forms of entertainment 
more legitimate than others, for example). Even as early as the 1950s and the 1960s pop artists Andy Warhol 
and Roy Lichtenstein achieved fame by challenging the stability of this very division. Warhol turned 
consumer products like the Campbell’s soup cans or pop celebrities like Marilyn Monroe into art icons while 
Lichtenstein took comic-strip and advertising images into the select space of the art gallery (see here).  

A second reason why Luhrmann’s film might be considered postmodernist is that it self-consciously 
advertises its own status as representation in at least two ways. It openly recycles Shakespeare’s text and, in a 
way, its own self as a film. It takes an event (the death of the two lovers) and presents it in three different 
ways, with each one emphatically calling attention to its storytelling qualities (the same “story” is recycled 
three times, each time starting the film anew). Given its self-identification as recyclable narrative, the opening 
scene is clearly asking a question. How can we tell the story of an event? How can we represent an event? In 
other words, how can we get to the real? What is strongly suggested is that we do not get the event but a 
representation of the event. The repetition of the Prologue serves to bring to the fore the fact that every 
attempt to grasp the real (the event of the lovers’ death) always leads us to a text (newspaper stories lead to a 
TV news programme which leads to Shakespeare’s play and so on). Another way in which Romeo + Juliet 
emphasizes its representational character is through its editing. The film’s fast editing and the abrupt, rapid 
sequence of camera shots with which viewers are bombarded disrupt the comforting effect of continuity 
editing which allows viewers to become immersed in the narrative plotline by helping them forget that they 
are watching a film.  

In drawing attention to itself as a series of camera shots, Luhrmann’s film highlights instead its own 
constructed character as filmic representation and makes a comment on the nature and the accessibility of the 
real. In Western metaphysics the categories of reality, fact and truth have been traditionally set against the 
notions of representation, fiction or falsehood. The basis of this opposition lies, as Magali Cornier Michael 
reminds us, in the belief that a stable, objective reality exists outside of representation. Realist aesthetics 
assumes that this reality can be represented directly, while modernists insist that the real is a question of 
perception and perspective. For postmodernists, material reality exists but it is always mediated by 
representations (Michael 37). Our perceptions, as it were, are continually mediated by culturally, socially and 
historically constructed meanings, emotions, fears and desires—which is perhaps one way of reading the 
controversial statement of the French critic Jacques Derrida that “there is nothing outside of the text” (“il n’ya 
pas de hors texte,” 158). To claim this is not to deny the materiality of the world but to admit that we cannot 
access it directly or unproblematically. Our daily lives may not be merely “textual” but they are made 
meaningful with the help of knowledges that are always already ideologically inflected, subject to fictions and 

Continuity editing: 
 

is the predominant style of film editing 
and video editing in the post-production 
process of filmmaking of narrative films 
and television programmes. The purpose 
of continuity editing is to smooth over the 

inherent discontinuity of the editing 
process and to establish a logical 

coherence between shots. In most films, 
logical coherence is achieved by cutting to 

continuity, which emphasizes smooth 
transition of time and space.

(self-)interests (class, gender or racial interests, to mention 
a few). Within this scheme of things, traditional distinctions 
between fact and fiction or truth and falsehood become 
increasingly difficult to maintain.  

Consider, for example, how Lurhmann’s opening 
scene plays with the cinematic convention of credit giving 
which usually takes place in a section of the film that 
clearly sets itself apart from the film’s fictional world in 
order to give credit to the crew. Unlike mainstream feature 
films, Luhrmann chooses to present the story’s leading 
characters in a series of frozen frames. Each character’s 
name appears next to the actor’s face in a way that reminds 
us of the credits section at the start or close of films and 
television series. Only that here the clear-cut division 
between fact and fiction has collapsed as it is not the 
actor’s name that appears next to the actor’s face but the 
character’s (compare it, for instance, to the opening credits 
of the television series The Bold and the Beautiful). To 
those inimical towards the postmodern, the loss of the real 
as an objectively verifiable category signifies the loss of 
history and the subject’s ability to transform his world (for 
this type of critical response to postmodernism see the 
work of the American literary theorist Fredric Jameson). To 
its defenders, disrupting the opposition between reality and 
fiction can be politically effective for marginalized groups. 
It encourages the critical examination of cultural codes that 
have sustained oppressive structures and reveals “the 
artificial basis of existing relations of power” (Michael 37), 
their “fictionality” as it were. To give an example, feminist 
attempts to critique patriarchal authority can be much 
helped by a critical formation such as that of 
postmodernism’s which exposes patriarchy’s norms (regarding, for example, the meanings assigned to 
femininity and masculinity in a given context) as culturally 
and historically constructed (that is, “fictional”). 

What is more, as Magali Cornier Michael observes, 
“the assertion that mediated representations are the only 
means of access to reality transforms art into a valid and 
potentially active space for political engagement” (37). 
Postmodernist fiction has indeed become a vehicle of 
gender and racial critique on both sides of the Atlantic 
since the middle of the twentieth century. Angela Carter 
and Margaret Atwood, for example, have drawn on 
postmodernist insights to challenge the power of myth and 
of fairy tales to disseminate patriarchal gender norms, 
while Jeanette Winterson has employed the notion of 
intertextual exchange to encourage us to rethink the idea of 
romantic love that is central to constructions of 
heterosexuality. Moreover, in the context of postcolonial 
critique, writers such as Salman Rushdie and J. M. Coetzee 
have located in the postmodern tools that enable them to 
disturb structures of racial inequality in Western 
conceptualizations of cultural difference. To exemplify the 
manner in which postmodernist fiction might be used to 
challenge hegemonic norms, I would now like to turn to 
Margaret Atwood’s short story “Women’s Novels” (1983). 

 
In a film, television program or video 

game, the opening credits are shown at 
the very beginning and list the most 

important members of the production. 
They are now usually shown as text 

superimposed on a blank screen or static 
pictures, or sometimes on top of action in 

the show. There may or may not be 
accompanying music. When opening 

credits are built into a separate sequence 
of their own, the correct term is title 

sequence (such as the familiar James Bond 
and Pink Panther title sequences). 

Opening credits since the early 1980s, if 
present at all, identify the major actors 

and crew, while the closing credits list an 
extensive cast and production crew.  

Metafiction: 
 

 Any work of fiction which seems 
preoccupied with its own fictionality or 

with the nature of fiction generally. In the 
same way as a metalanguage reflects on 
language(s), metafiction is fiction whose 
subject is fiction. Metafiction differs from 
realist fiction, which employs all kinds of 
techniques—linear narrative, cause and 

effect, detailed description, rich 
characters and dialogue—to encourage 

readers to feel that what they are reading 
corresponds with reality. Metafiction, by 
contrast, obliges its readers to consider 

first and foremost its own artifice; it 
disrupts the illusion that fiction gives 

direct access to the “real world.” Common 
techniques include beginnings and 

endings which comment on the nature of 
beginnings and endings; the appearance 
of the author as a character (who may 
well discuss the process of writing the 

narrative); and the realization by 
characters that they are merely 

characters.

Modernist and Postmodernist Fiction(s) 
 

Atwood’s story is concerned throughout with acts 
of reading, storytelling and gender. It focuses on the novels 
that women like to read (and write) as well as the novels 
men prefer to buy (or write) and draws our attention to 
dominant gender representations that are frequently 
invoked in mainstream fiction. In that sense, the story’s 
metafictional character—that is, the fact that it is fiction 
that discusses fiction—is hard to miss. Very much like 
Luhrmann’s film, the short story also self-consciously 
signals its awareness of its own fictionality and standing as 
representation (it acknowledges the fact that it is a story) 
by attracting attention to its own textual processes and 
attempts at shattering the “transparency” effect that realism 
strives to achieve. Not many realist conventions are 
adhered to here: the narrative voice (though humorous and 
cheeky) is hard to locate; there is no distinguishable plot or 
linearity or any type of resolution; the reader is not kept 
respectfully outside the “action” (and in charge of it) but is 
drawn right into it, shaken out of his position of 
comfortable invisibility by being turned into an object of 
analysis. And this is because what Atwood’s story does 
best is talk about readers. It dissects and calls attention to our reading habits, suggesting that how we read 
fictional stories (what we like about them or how we make sense of them) is inextricably connected to how we 
read and understand gender. It is interesting to follow how the narrative projects its concern with the reading 
of gender. First, it draws attention to the popular gender clichés that are recycled from novel to novel. Second, 
by self-consciously underlining the intertextual recycling of these stereotypical representations, it points to the 
culturally and discursively constructed character of the gender realities they speak of.  

From the start of the story we are warned that if “Men favor heroes who are tough and hard: tough 
with men, hard with women” (29), women are attracted to romantic stories with chivalrous men and happy 
endings. As the narrator admits, “I like to read novels in which the heroine has a costume rustling discreetly 
over her breasts, or discreet breasts rustling under her costume; in any case there must be a costume, some 
breasts, some rustling, and, over all, discretion. Discretion over all, like a fog, a miasma through which the 
outlines of things appear only vaguely. A glimpse of pink through the gloom, the sound of breathing, satin 
slithering to the floor, revealing what?” (29). The story invokes here an image of femininity that may be taken 
from romantic fiction. Is it a heroine secretly meeting a lover? Or a chance encounter between two future 
lovers? The narrator’s reverie? In any case, sexual desire is powerfully invoked. We can almost hear the sound 
of her breathing as her “discreet” breasts heave with “discreet” desire under the rustling silk of her dress. 
Repeatedly emphasized by the narrative, discretion implies here social rules that must not be broken and the 
representation of women in this passage is firmly tied both to discretion and society. It suggests that female 
sexuality displayed in public is not socially acceptable (as respectable womanhood must be coy and chaste), 
which of course makes it all the more titillating in the eyes of a lover and certainly more intriguing for readers.  

Moreover, to continue with another popular representation of femininity visited by Atwood’s text, the 
association of respectable femininity with virtue has also been a powerful, middle-class gender stereotype in 
modernity. It is regularly posited, in stories and films, as the prerequisite for a happy ending in marriage and 
everlasting love. Listen to the narrator speaking again: “I want happiness, guaranteed, joy all round, covers 
with nurses on them or brides, intelligent girls but not too intelligent, with regular teeth and pluck and both 
breasts the same size and no excess facial hair, someone you can depend on to know where the bandages are 
and to turn the hero, that potential rake and killer, into a well-groomed country gentleman with clean 
fingernails and the right vocabulary. Always, he has to say, Forever. I no longer want to read books that don’t 
end with the word forever. I want to be stroked between the eyes, one way only” (31). The narrator puts her 
finger here on the fairy-tale motif that turns happy-ending stories into such a good read for so many women. 
Happiness is ultimately achieved. But the precondition for happiness, both in the novels and the readers’ real-
life situations, is that women fulfill their destiny as paragons of virtue. They must safeguard public morality 
by transforming wayward men into respectable members of society. This is a gender norm whose 
representation can be encountered equally in a Harlequin romantic story and in a classic novel such as Jane 

Intertextuality: 
 

 is the name often given to the manner in 
which texts of all sorts (oral, visual, 

literary, virtual) contain references to 
other texts that have, in some way, 

contributed to their production and 
signification. The notion was initially 

introduced by the French feminist theorist 
Julia Kristeva. Intertextuality, with its 

endlessly receding network of debts and 
legacies, disturbs a casual belief in the 

uniqueness of the text and of the 
originality of the authorial consciousness.

Terms 121-122)

Eyre. It repeats itself and is recycled, passing from novel to novel and reader to reader and disseminating in 
the process patriarchal ideas of gender. 
 Atwood’s feminist—and postmodernist—gesture consists in drawing attention to this recycling 
process quite self-consciously. It reproduces a series of dominant representations of femininity and 
masculinity as encountered in (popular romantic) fiction and encourages us to read them critically. Humour 
functions as a powerful defamiliarising, critical device in this respect. In the story’s final lines, the narrator is 
caught trying to decode metaphors used quite frequently in fictional writing to construct a heroine as a 
precious and desirable catch, pure and untamed as a wild animal and, therefore, precious to possess.  
 

Margaret Atwood, from “Women’s Novels” 
 

She had the startled eyes of a wild bird. This is the kind of sentence I go mad for. I would 
like to be able to write such sentences, without embarrassment. I would like to be able to read them 
without embarrassment. If I could only do these two simple things, I feel, I would be able to pass my 
allotted time on this earth like a pearl wrapped in velvet. 

She had the startled eyes of a wild bird. Ah, but which one? A screech owl, perhaps, or a 
cuckoo? It does make a difference. We do not need more literalists of the imagination. They cannot 
read a body like a gazelle’s without thinking of intestinal parasites, zoos, and smells. 

She had a feral gaze like that of an untamed animal, I read. Reluctantly I put down the book, 
thumb still inserted at the exciting moment. He’s about to crush her in his arms, pressing his hot, 
devouring, hard, demanding mouth to hers as her breasts squish out the top of her dress, but I can’t 
concentrate. Metaphor leads me by the nose, into the maze, and suddenly all Eden lies before me. 
Porcupines, weasels, warthogs, and skunks, their feral gazes malicious or bland or stolid or piggy 
and sly. Agony, to see the romantic frisson quivering just out of reach, a dark-winged butterfly stuck 
to an overripe peach, and not be able to swallow, or wallow. Which one? I murmur to the 
unresponding air. Which one? (32-33) 

 
The narrator’s almost comical attempt at guessing which wild animal the heroine could be likened to 

is not an effect that the steamy love story which she is reading at this point ever intended to produce. Rather, it 
breaks the “spell” and her identification with the characters, and stops her from becoming emotionally 
involved with, and absorbed into, the love scene as expected. In that sense, her unplanned, unconventional, 
quite humorous, response to the love story unsettles the story’s anticipated effect and the reader’s 
identification with the romantic heroine and all that she represents in terms of gender. It works, for one, to 
remind us that the love scene in question is a fictional convention, a narrative and gender cliché that moves 
across texts and ends up being a copy of a copy which does not necessarily convey the truth about men and 
women. The metaphor of the wild bird is foregrounded precisely as a metaphor, language used to construct a 
representation of femininity which is seen now as a linguistic and cultural construct. It is fair to argue that the 
postmodernist focus on representation in Atwood’s text reveals not only the mediated character of reality but 
the extent to which this mediation is gender-coded. Its feminist challenge materializes within the system of 
patriarchal representational exchange (the mainstream stories women like to read) and encourages us to read it 
differently, or to use Linda Hutcheon’s term, denaturalize it. In Hutcheon’s words, “the postmodern’s initial 
concern is to denaturalize some of the dominant features of our way of life; to point out that those entities that 
we unthinkingly experience as ‘natural’ (they might even include capitalism, patriarchy, liberal humanism) are 
in fact ‘cultural’: made by us, not given to us. Even nature, postmodernism might point out, doesn’t grow on 
trees” (2). 

4.2 Difference and the Subject 

Hutcheon identifies here what is politically progressive about the postmodern and allows a glimpse into the 
reasons why it has engaged the interest of feminist and postcolonial thinkers. To accept that the world, or 
rather our perception of it, is not “given” or “natural” but constructed in language, history and culture is a 

177 
 



Modernist and Postmodernist Fiction(s) 
 

thought that has appealed to marginalized groups who have had restrictive and often denigrating identities 
imposed on them. It implies that our understanding of the world, filtered as it is through representations and 
the stories that we tell ourselves and each other about it, can be rewritten and reformulated. It can be changed 
along with all the dominant discourses that have oppressively circumscribed, for example, women’s sexuality 
or black inferiority over the ages.  

What also contributes to a politically enabling view of the real in postmodernism is the thought that 
our understanding of the world is made up not of one but numerous narratives that are in circulation 
interacting and competing with each other. This markedly contrasts with modernity’s desire to explain a huge 
variety of phenomena in life in terms of one overarching and all-inclusive story, what Jean-François Lyotard 
terms a “grand narrative.” Patriarchy, Europe, Christianity, Marxism and psychoanalysis provide examples of 
grand narratives since each one of them attempts to present the world as being organized around one central 
idea that it considers universally applicable—whether this might be masculine superiority, white supremacy, 
the word of God, the laws of capitalism or the unconscious. The postmodern is the moment when we lose faith 
in the power of these grand narratives to deliver the truth about our experience in the singular, and accept the 
need to consider alternative representations of the real, which might have been so far sidelined and excluded, 
as equally legitimate. Attention is now directed to smaller, local narratives whose value and truth is judged 
within specific contexts, making the truth value of any given narrative or world view the product of an 
ongoing negotiation, hence contingent and changeable. In other words, in the postmodern outlook, no 
explanatory narrative is equally valid for all across time and space, a thought that is not alien to students of 
literature, who as trained readers of texts, are well aware of the multiplicity of readings a literary text can 
receive, all of which are dependent on the historical and cultural contexts within which they are produced and 
received (hence a Shakespearean play may receive a different reading in contemporary China than it did in 
eighteenth-century England).  

Postmodernism’s interventions in representational practices in literature and art are underwritten by 
this contingent politics of difference, the need to begin to acknowledge the existence of different viewpoints 
on the real and their struggle for legitimation. To give a quick example, Jean Rhys in Wide Sargasso Sea 
offers an alternative representation of Rochester’s first, mad Creole wife Bertha Mason, as given in Charlotte 
Bronte’s Jane Eyre, through a fictional text that experiments with style, structure and point of view. Her 
account of Antoinette’s (as Bertha is known in the novel) life before she meets Rochester, with its emphasis 
on the historical and social circumstances that led to the collapse of the plantation system in the West Indies in 
the middle of the nineteenth century, not only explains Bertha’s madness but strongly suggests that it is an 
identity fabricated to serve the interests of patriarchy and colonialism that Rochester represents in the text. 
The novel provides in this way an alternative account both of Jane Eyre’s representation of the specific Creole 
“mad woman in the attic” and, more generally, Europe’s negotiation of racial and cultural difference at this 
point in time. It provides, in other words, a story different to that circulating in nineteenth-century Europe 
about racially different women which makes a claim to legitimacy and destabilizes the grand narrative of 
white supremacy (rendered now as contingent in its truth claims as the marginal narrative that competes 
against it). 

The changes brought about by the loss of faith in grand narratives and the postmodern’s valorization 
of (contingently articulated) difference has also affected its thinking on identity. Postmodernism rigorously 
challenges ideas about the subject as conceived by Enlightenment humanism. The self-contained, unified and 
coherent modern subject (one with the Eiffel Tower visitor) gives way to the decentred and fragmented 
subject of postmodernity. It is telling that we now use the term “subjectivity” to speak about identity. It is a 
linguistic choice that reflects a more general understanding of individual identity as being “subject” to 
language, history and culture, as being produced, rather than given, as a result of circumstances and variables 
that are at work in specific contexts. Subjectivity speaks of positions, those positions in which we are placed 
when we are interpellated (addressed) by ideology and language (for example, men are traditionally placed in 
“positions” of superiority by patriarchal ideologies while women in positions of inferiority).  

Following on the psychoanalytic discovery of the unconscious, subjectivity as a term also implies the 
“self-divided” subject, that is, one’s self-perception which is not complete—as there is always something 
about it that escapes our conscious control. What postmodern theories of the subject often throw light on—
reworking the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan—is the existence of this other 
(unconscious) space within us which, in effect, also works to blur the boundaries between self and other in 
society, rendering our relationship to others (individuals or communities) contingent.  

178 
 



Effie Yiannopoulou 
 

To detractors of the postmodern this notion of the subject signifies a loss of control which is construed 
as debilitating as it is assumed to be taking power away from the subject’s individual agency and ability to 
control his fate, his will and his world. To defenders of the postmodern, it creates an opening towards the 
other that helps build a relationship not of domination of the self over the other but a relationship that relies on 
self-interrogation. That has the potential of creating respect for that which is not “us” and is, therefore, 
unknown to us (that in itself can function as the basis of a cultural politics of difference that allows individual 
subjects and communities to develop more inclusive modes of interaction). If, then, human identity is, for 
postmodernism, a question of positionality, context and perspective, it is at once suggested as plural, 
contingent and changeable. It is no wonder, in that sense, that it is popular with many women writers and 
artists.  

Take, for example, the case of Barbara Krüger’s photographic collage Untitled (You are not Yourself), 
(1981). It is a self-conscious piece of art that makes visual and explicit the feminist and postmodern 
conception of woman as a non-essential, social construct. Displaying a woman examining herself in a 
shattered mirror, Krüger interprets the myth of woman as a social mechanism by which a restrictive identity is 
imposed on women (femininity is traditionally seen as being associated with specific attributes such as 
motherhood, weakness, emotion, home and so on). She uses bold graphic techniques to jar the woman, as well 
as the viewer, in the mirror delivering a wake-up call from the messages delivered by society. The small size 
of the word “not” indicates that society attempts to trick women into believing “You Are Yourself,” you are, 
that is, what dominant discourses dictate that you are (for more see here). The word “not,” however, also 
shatters the mirror society holds up to women, breaks the surface on which identity is constructed and 
suggests a multiplicity of selves in existence. The fragmented mirror speaks, for some, of an impossible 
demand issued by society that expects women to play a variety of roles simultaneously; to others, it 
constitutes an acknowledgement that the self is never unitary and hence the single affirmative identity 
conferred on us (“You are yourself”) is a representation that can be shattered.

4.3 Banksy’s Dismaland: A Bemusement Park

As a way of rounding off the discussion on the postmodern, I would like to make a reference to Banksy’s 
Dismaland, an art work, or art performance, which is driven on by the postmodern impulse to challenge 
established beliefs about representation and reality. Banksy, a street artist whose identity remains a secret, hit 
the British newspapers’ headlines in August 2015 with the creation of a theme park on the Weston-super-
Mare seafront in the west of England which the artist describes as “unsuitable for small children” (Brown) 
(http://dismaland.co.uk/; for a video see here). This is no understatement when you consider that the Grim 
Reaper rides the dodgems and Cinderella lies dead in her crashed princely carriage surrounded by paparazzi.

And these are only two exhibits on the site. The unconventionality of the theme park is evident from the start 
when visitors are forced to go through a security control of the type endured at airports and are faced with 
unsmiling, unhelpful, depressed-looking attendants some of whom are selling “I am an Imbecile” black 
helium balloons and are reportedly briefed to respond to every request for information with a sullen shrug or 
“wanker” gesture. What follows may comprise sticking your head through a hole and taking a picture of 
yourself as a terrorist, the drive-your-own model boats full of desperate migrants or visiting a “pocket money 
loans” shop offering money to children at an interest rate of 5,000%.

In front of its counter is a small trampoline so that children can bounce up to read the outrageous small print 
drawn up by artist Darren Cullen (Brown).  

In fact, Dismaland features the work of 58 handpicked artists, including Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer 
and Banksy’s own, all of which address the “culture of happiness” which seems to be at the butt end of 
contemporary consumerism and entertainment (Dinseyland-type) business. Dismaland is both shocking and 
funny and gets visitors to think about what is left out of their world picture so that they can lead their affluent, 
“happy” Western lifestyles. It is amazing to think how much contemporary western cultures have invested in 
the concept of happiness which is tied not only to the efficient operation of a well-oiled capitalist system but 
to the smoothing over of its contradictions and inconsistencies. Consider, for example, that in November 2010 
the British Prime Minister David Cameron assembled a group of journalists in the Treasury for a speech on 
national happiness which was the result of a recently discovered insight in his government that bringing 
understandings of psychology to policy making will increase citizen contentment and as a result the state’s tax 
revenues (Thring). As it appears, creating happy citizens is both a cultural and a government aim in Britain 
these days.  

Dismaland is a response to this climate of unruptured self contentment. When asked why the world 
needs Dismaland, Banksy replied “Dismaland is an experiment in offering something less resolved. Why 
should children be immune from the idea that to maintain our standard of life, other children have to die 
trapped in the hulls of boats in the bottom of the Mediterranean?” (Mills). In Dismaland, children and adults 
become acquainted with the debt-creating world which they inhabit or are confronted with their 
“involvement” in world terrorism when taking their pictures as terrorists (no more immunity from accepting 
responsibility in world politics).  

In closing I would like to point out that Dismaland is beyond doubt art that “surprises.” It upsets the 
visitors’ expectations and breaks with what theme parks and fairgrounds have come to stand for in our cultural 
imaginary (pleasure, excitement, comfort). It disorients our understanding of leisure time and all the values 
connected with it and does so by inhabiting the system. Dismaland re-creates what is perhaps a consumer’s, a 
tourist’s or a family’s paradise, a theme park, but with a difference since it has changed the rules that

Re-Cap: 
 

The Postmodern (main features): 
 
 Draws attention to the role of representation in 

constructions of reality.  
 

 Decentres the liberal humanist subject. 
 

 Breaks down the distinction between high and 
popular culture. 
 

 Upsets the system it critiques from within. 
 

 Is marked by increased self-consciousness about the 
methods it uses. 
 

 Relies on recycling and intertextual exchange. 

determine how it operates and how we relate to it as viewers-visitors. In raising issues of war, famine, death 
and exploitation through its exhibits, it causes visitors to confront their own habits of living, values and 
priorities in life in ways that are not always clear (this is a “bemusement park” after all) but in a productive 
fashion (mirth and discomfort are both present). One might say that Banksy’s artwork materialises what the 
postmodern aims to do according to Lyotard: it “puts forward the unpresentable in presentation itself” 
(“Answering the Question” 81). It surprises us out of our certainties—it surprises, in fact, the system itself out 
of its certainties by forcing it to face its contradictions—and creates a space in our thought which is not yet 
full of the familiar and is ready to take on the unknown—with varying results and surprisingly not always 
dismally.
