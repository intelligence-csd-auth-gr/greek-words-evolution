Do you really know 

how many illusions

the lightweight shirt

I escape in the moment 

As if, it is time 

Aσι ξω ξψ, ξψσ’ω ξω? 
 

- Time does not pass, I used to say, rather we 

pass - 

 

What certainty we have maintained with time-

telling instruments 

A watch 

A clock 

Other time-telling pieces 

Are we not manufacturing them? 

 

 

Wind them up, you can, and let them show 

Today 

Forever.

How carelessly 

we bargained

We thought that it was 

all ours to keep.

Script - "Linear A" II 
 

 

 

My verses have been lost 

They have nothing to convey 

And they are deserting me 

 

But if they could speak 

- if they could constantly speak - 

They would sadly repeat themselves 

 

I thank them 

 

For they have protected me 

- at least - 

From this 

Decline

The Truth Inside 

 
No, 

No ashes. 

 

Give colors to the anguish 

So that I think of it as normal. 

 

You see the shadows of darkness can be a 

loathsome influence 

Just like anger 

And falling in love 

 

But everybody knows that.
