            I would like to sign the manifesto
            
            
                as a person            
            
            
                as an organisation            
        


        
            
                We will not share your e-mail address with anyone and will only use it to send you a confirmation link. We will only publish your name and organisation on the Public Domain Manifesto website along with the other signers.

If you give us permission we will also add your email address to a very low volume mailing list which we may use to reach out in situations where the principles enshrined in the manifesto are under attack and we may need your help in “defending them”.

The Public Domain Manifesto was produced within the context of COMMUNIA, the European thematic network on the digital public domain (2007-2011). The Nexa Center for Internet and Society at the Politecnico di Torino, coordinator of the COMMUNIA project, curated the Manifesto between 2011 and 2019.
